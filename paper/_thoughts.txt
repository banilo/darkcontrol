Guillaume's ideas:
------------------
- 2 types of figures: biology vs. algo
* bio: give a lot of experimental examples
*

- 2 way argument:
-----------------
* we did not invent POMDP but it is one of the most attractive current approaches to
general purpose intelligence algorithms; "parsimoneous" + "combines decision making and learning"
* our suggestion is backed up by recent practical advances/success of these state-of-art
algorithms
=> provably succesful in real-world problems + parsimoneous + bridge between decision making and learning

===> the further you are from the sensory inputs, the more we need to be model-free


- we need a snappy and flashy term to associate the paper/ideas with

- How is our approach related to transfer learning?

- explore how to improve didactis based on figures

- VAE -> appendix

- sentinel hypothesis: Supra-human cognitive control / Frith

- "putting together" -> first thing in "Relation to other cognitive theories"

- "Relation to other statistical models" -> appendix?

- Find ways to propose attractive task models for the bottom-up Gustav Deco crowd,
including McIntosh
