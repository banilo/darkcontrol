\section{Introduction}
%
In the absence of external stimulation, the human brain is not at rest.
At the turn to the 21st century,
brain-imaging may have been the first technique
to allow for the discovery of a unique brain network that would subserve
baseline mental activities
\citep{raichle2001pnas, randy2008, bzdok2015resting}.
The ``default mode network'' (DMN) continues
to metabolize large quantities of
oxygen and glucose energy to maintain
neuronal computation
during free-ranging thought
\citep{kenet2003spontaneously, fiser2004small}.
The baseline energy demand is only weakly modulated
at the onset of defined psychological tasks \citep{raichle_baseline}.
At its opposite, during sleep, the
decoupling of brain structures discarded the idea of the DMN being
only a passive network resonance and rather supported an
important role in sustaining conscious awareness \citep{horovitz2009decoupling}.



This \textit{dark matter of brain physiology}
\citep{raichle2006brain} begs the question
of the biological purpose underlying neural activity in the DMN,
which however still remains elusive at the electrophysiological level
\citep{de2010temporal,brookes2011investigating,baker2014fast}.
% the link between the fMRI BOLD signal and population-level neural activity is still unclear. If those frequency-specific electrophysiological correlations are proposed as complementary to those observed with BOLD \citep{hipp2015bold}, their role in DMN function remains elusive \citep{maldjian2014graph}.
What has early been described as the ``stream of consciousness''
in psychology \citep{james1890principles}
found a potential neurobiological manifestation
in the DMN
\citep{shul1997, raichle2001pnas}.
%
Axonal tracing injection in such parts of the association cortex in monkeys
were shown to resemble connectivity links between nodes of the human
DMN (see here for details on anatomical connections: \citep{randy2008}).
Additionally, myelination patterns of axon connections were found to finish
particularly late in these cortical areas \citep{flechsig1920}, often believed to suggest
sophistication of subserved neural processes
\citep{Sowell2003, Yakovlev1967}.
%
We propose that this set of some of the most advanced regions in
the association cortex \citep{mesulam1998sensation, margulies2016situating}
are responsible for higher-order control of human behavior.
Our functional account follows the notion of
``a hierarchy of brain systems with
the DMN at the top and the salience and dorsal attention systems
at intermediate levels, above thalamic and unimodal sensory
cortex'' \citep{carhart2010default}.



\subsection{Towards a formal account of default mode function: higher-order control of the organism}
The network nodes that compose the human DMN
are hubs of high baseline neural activity,
which typically decreases when engaged in controlled psychological experiments
\citep{raichle_baseline}.
The standard mode of
neural information maintenance and manipulation has
been argued to mediate evolutionarily conserved functions
\citep{brown1914nature, binder1999conceptual, buzsaki2006rhythms}.
Today, many psychologists and neuroscientists believe that
the DMN implements some form of
probabilistic estimation of past, hypothetical, and
future events
\citep{fox2005, hassabis2007patients, schacter2007remembering, binder2009,
randy2008, spreng2009common}.
This brain network
might have emerged to continuously predict the environment using
mental imagery as an evolutionary advantage \citep{suddendorf2007evolution}.
%
However, information processing in the DMN has also repeatedly
been shown to directly impact human behavior. Goal-directed task performance
improved with decreased activity in default mode regions \citep{weiss2006}
and increased DMN activity was linked to more task-independent,
yet sometimes useful thoughts
\citep{mason2007, seli2016mind}.
%
Gaining insight into DMN function is
particularly challenging because
this brain network appears to
simultaneously modulate perception-action cycles in the present
and to support mental travel
across time, space, and content domains
\citep{boyer2008evolutionary}.



We aim at proposing an alternative to reasoning about the DMN
based on longstanding cognitive theory.
The present work adopts the control-theoretical perspective of
a human \textit{agent} faced with the choice of the next actions
and guided by outcomes to optimize behavioral performance. These outcomes
can be really experienced, hypothetically imagined, or simply expected in the future.
Formally, we propose reinforcement learning as a particularly attractive framework
for describing, containing, and quantifying the unknown function underlying DMN activity.
An intelligent agent improves the interaction with the environment
by continuously updating its computation of value estimates and action predispositions
through integration of feedback outcomes.
That is, ``[agents], with their actions, modify the environment and in doing so
partially determine their next stimuli, in particular stimuli that are necessary
for triggering the next action''
\citep{pezzulo2011grounding}.
Agents with other behavioral policies therefore sample different
distributions of action-perception trajectories \citep{ghavamzadeh2015bayesian}.
Henceforth,
\textit{control} refers to the influence that an agent exerts when interacting
with the environment to reach preferred states.

At the psychological level,
the more the ongoing executed task is unknown and unpracticed,
the less stimulus-independent thoughts occur
\citep{filler1973daydreaming, teasdale1995stimulus, christoff2016mind}.
Conversely,
it has been empirically shown that, the more the world is easy to foresee,
the more human mental activity
becomes detached from the actual sensory environment
\citep{antrobus1966studies, pope1978regulation, mason2007, weiss2006}.
Without requiring explicit awareness,
these ``offline'' processes may contribute
to optimizing control of the organism in general.
We formalize
a \textit{policy matrix} to capture the space of possible actions that
the agent can perform
on the environment given the current state. A \textit{value function}
maps environmental objects and events (i.e., states) to expected reward outcomes.
Switching between states reduces to a sequential processing model.
Informed by outcomes of performed actions, neural computation reflected in
DMN dynamics could be constantly shaped by prediction error through feedback loops.
The present computational account of DMN function will be described in the mathematical framework of Markov Decision Processes (MDP). MDPs specifically formalize decision making in stochastic contexts with reward feedback.



Such a RL perspective on DMN function can naturally embed human behavior
into the tension between exploitative action with immediate gains and
exploratory action with longer-term gratification.
We argue that DMN implication in many
of the most advanced human capacities
can be recast as prediction error minimization
informed by internally generated probabilistic simulations
- ``covert forms of action and perception'' \citep{pezzulo2011grounding} -,
allowing maximization of action outcomes across different time scales.
Such a purposeful optimization objective
may be solved by a stochastic approximation
based on a brain implementation of Monte Carlo sampling.
Even necessarily imperfect memory recall,
random day-time mind-wandering, and
seemingly arbitrary dreams during sleep
may provide randomly sampled blocks of pseudo-experience  that are
instrumental to iteratively
optimize the behavioral agenda of the organism.



Evidence from computational modeling of human behavior \citep{kording2004bayesian} and cell recording experiments in ferrets \citep{fiser2004small} suggest that
much of brain activity is dedicated to
``the development and maintenance of [a]
probabilistic model of anticipated events''
\citep{raichle2005intrinsic}.
The present paper proposes a
process model that satisfies this previously proposed contention.
We also contribute to the discussion of DMN function
by providing tentative evidence that
variation of the grey-matter volume in DMN regions
is linked to the reward circuitry (Fig. 2),
thus linking two literatures with currently scarce cross-references.
Finally,
we derive explicit hypotheses that could be tested in targeted neuroscience
experiments in the future
and
we detail how our process model relates
to previous cognitive and theoretical accounts of DMN function.



Please appreciate the importance of differentiating which levels of observation are at play in the present account. A process model is not solely intended to capture behavior of the agent, such as cognitive accounts of DMN function, but also the neurocomputational specifics of the agent. Henceforth, we will use ``inference`` when referring to aspects of the statistical model, ``prediction`` when referring to the neurobiological implementation, and words like ``forecast`` or ``forsee`` when referring to the behavior of the agent.
%
It is moreover important to note that
our account does not claim that neural activity in the DMN in particular
or the brain in general are identical with reinforcement learning algorithms.
Rather, we advocate feedback-based learning strategies as an attractive alternative perspective
to describe, quantify, and interpret research findings on the DMN.



\section{Known neurobiological properties of the default mode network}
\label{sec:nodes}
We begin by a neurobiological deconstruction of the DMN
based on integrating experimental findings in the neuroscience literature
from different species.
This walkthrough across main functional zones of the DMN
(i.e., de-emphasizing their precise anatomical properties)
will outline the individual functional profiles with the goal of
paving the way for their algorithmic interpretation
in our formal account (section 3).
As our focus will be on major \textit{functional} zones of the DMN,
please see elsewhere for excellent surveys on their \textit{anatomical}
boundaries and connectivity patterns \citep{randy2008, binder2009, seghier2013angular}.

  %
  Axonal tracing in monkeys and diffusion tractography in humans suggested
  that the NAc of the reward circuitry has monosynaptic fiber connections
  to the vmPFC \citep{haber1995, croxson2005quantitative}. Evaluation of
  propagated value information and triggered affective states encoded
  in the vmPFC may then feed into the functionally connected partner nodes of
  the DMN, such as the dmPFC and PMC \citep{andrews2010, bzdok2013segregation}.

%
\subsection{The posteromedial cortex: global monitoring and information integration}
The midline structures of the human DMN,
including the posteromedial cortex (PMC) and
the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),
are probably responsible for highest turn-overs
of energy consumption \citep{raichle2001pnas, raichle_baseline}.
These metabolic characteristics go hand-in-hand with
brain-imaging findings that suggested the PMC and mPFC to
potentially represent the functional core of the DMN
\citep{andrews2010, hagmann2008mapping}.


Normal and disturbed metabolic fluctuations in the
human PMC have been closely related to
changes of conscious awareness \citep{cavanna2006precuneus, leech_pcc2014}.
Indeed,
the PMC matures relatively late (i.e., myelination) during postnatal development in monkeys
\citep{goldman1987development}, which is generally considered to
be a sign of evolutionary sophistication.
%
This DMN region has long been speculated to
reflect constant computation of
environmental statistics and its internal representation
as an inner ``mind's eye'' \citep{cavanna2006precuneus, leech_pcc2014}.
For instance, B\'alint's syndrome is a neurological disorder of conscious
awareness that can result from tissue damage in the posterior medial cortex
\citep{balint1909seelenlahmung, randy2008}.
Such neurological patients are plagued by an
inability to bind various individual features of the visual
environment into an integrated whole (i.e., simultanagnosia)
as well as an inability to direct action towards
currently unattended environmental objects
(i.e., optic ataxia).
%
Scanning complex scenes is impaired in that statistic or moving objects in the
environment may be invisible or disappear in the subject perception of the
patient \citep{mesulam_book, blumenfeld_book}.
%
This dysfunction can be viewed as a high-level impairment in gathering
information about alternative objects (i.e., exploration) as well as
using these environmental opportunities towards a behavioral goal (i.e., exploitation).
Congruently,
the human PMC was coupled in two different functional connectivity analyses
\citep{bzdok2015subspecialization}
with the amygdala, involved in significance evaluation, and
the nucleus accumbens (NAc), involved in reward evaluation.
Specifically, among all parts of the PMC,
the ventral posterior cingulate cortex was
most connected to the laterobasal
nuclei group of the amygdala
\citep{bzdok2015subspecialization}.
This amygdalar subregion has been proposed to
continuously scan environmental input
for biological relevance assessment
\citep{amygdala_bzdok, ghods2009fundamental, baxter2002amygdala}.


The putative role of the PMC in continuous abstract integration of
environmental relevance
and ensuing top-level guidance of action on the environment is supported
by many neuroscience experiments.
Electrophysiological recordings in animals implicated PMC neurons in
strategic decision making \citep{pearson2009neurons},
risk assessment \citep{mccoy2005risk},
outcome-dependent behavioral modulation \citep{hayden2009electrophysiological},
as well as approach-avoidance behavior
\citep{vann2009does}.
Neuron spiking activity in the PMC allowed distinguishing
whether a monkey would pursue an exploratory or exploitative
behavioral strategy during food foraging \citep{pearson2009neurons}.
Further, single-cell recordings in the monkey PMC
demonstrated this brain region's sensitivity to
subjective target utility \citep{mccoy2005risk} and integration
across individual decision-making instances \citep{pearson2009neurons}.
This DMN region encoded the
preference for or aversion to options with uncertain reward outcomes
and its neural spiking activity was more associated with
subjectively perceived relevance of a chosen object
than by its actual value,
based on an ``internal currency of value'' \citep{mccoy2005risk}.
In fact, direct stimulation of PMC neurons in monkeys
promoted exploratory actions,
which would otherwise be shunned \citep{hayden2008stim}.
Graded changes in firing rates of PMC neurons
indicated changes in upcoming choice trials, while their neural patterns were
distinct from neuronal spike firings that indicated choosing either option.
Similarly in humans,
the DMN has been shown to gather and integrate information
over different parts of auditory narratives in an fMRI study
\citep{simony2016dynamic}.


Moreover, the retrosplenial portion of the PMC could support
representation of action possibilities
and evaluation of reward outcomes by integrating
information from memory recall and different perspective frames.
Regarding memory recall, retrosplenial damage has been
consistently associated with anterograde and retrograde memory impairments
of various kinds of sensory information
in animals and humans
\citep{vann2009does}.
Regarding perspective frames, the retrosplenial subregion of the PMC has been
proposed to mediate between the organism's egocentric
(i.e., focused on external sensory environment) and
allocentric (i.e., focused on internal world knowledge) viewpoints
in animals and humans
\citep{epstein2008parahippocampal, burgess2008spatial, valiquette2007different}.



Consequently, the PMC may contribute to overall DMN function
by monitoring the subjective outcomes
of possible actions and integrating that information
with memory and perspective frames
into short- and longer-term behavioral agendas.
Estimated value, found to differs across individuals, might enrich
statistical assessment of the environment
to map and predict delayed reward opportunities in the future.
Viewed from a RL perspective, the PMC may continuously adapt the organism to changes
in both the external environment and its internal representation
to enable strategic behavior.


\subsection{The prefrontal cortex: action consideration and stimulus-value association}
Analogous to the PMC,
the dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC, related to BA9) of the DMN is believed to subserve
multi-sensory processes
across time, space, and content domains to
exert top-level control on behavior.
Comparing to the PMC, however,
dmPFC function may be closer to a
``mental sketchpad'' \citep{goldman1996prefrontal}. This DMN part
potentially subserves the de-novo construction and manipulation
of meaning representations instructed by stored semantics and memories
\citep{bzdok2013segregation}.
The dmPFC may subserve representation and assessment
of one's own and other individuals' action considerations - a necessary
component of a full-blown RL agent.
Generally,
neurological patients with tissue damage in the prefrontal cortex
are known to struggle with
adaptation to new stimuli and events
\citep{stuss1986frontal}.
Specifically, neural activity in the human dmPFC
reflected expectations about other peoples' actions and
outcomes of these predictions.
Neural activity in the dmPFC indeed explained the performance decline
of inferring other peoples' thoughts in aging humans \citep{moran2012social}.
Certain dmPFC neurons in macaque monkeys exhibited a preference
for processing others', rather than own, action
with fine-grained adjustment of contextual aspects \citep{yoshida2010neural}.
% In fact, the spatially neighboring dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
% has also been linked to computing values and efforts of
% persisting a behavioral plan versus switching the
% environmental context in several lesion studies \citep{kolling2016value}.
%
% Such highly abstract neural computations necessarily rely on the
% construction of probabilistic internal information drawing from
% memory recall, mental scene elaboration processes,
% and stored knowledge of world regularities.
% %
% Moreover,
% in a computational brain-imaging experiment,
% dorsomedial PFC activity preferentially processed the consequences of
% action choices that were considered but not actually executed,
% whereas ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) activity
% processed especially value outcomes of actions actually performed on the environment
% \citep{nicolle2012agent}.


Comparing to the dmPFC,
the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC, related to BA10) is probably more specifically devoted to
subjective value evaluation and
risk estimation of relevant environmental stimuli
(Fig. \ref{fig:neurobiological_overview_DMN} and \ref{fig:dmn}).
The ventromedial prefrontal DMN may
subserve adaptive behavior by bottom-up-driven
processing of “what matters now”,
drawing on sophisticated value representations
\citep{rolls_OFC, doherty2015structure}.
Quantitative lesion findings across 344 human individuals confirmed
a substantial impairment in value-based action choice
\citep{glascher2012lesion}.
Indeed,
this DMN region is preferentially connected with reward-related and limbic regions.
The vmPFC is well known to have direct connections
with the NAc
in axonal tracing studies in monkeys \citep{haber1995orbital}.
Congruently, the gray-matter volume of the vmPFC and NAc
correlated with indices of value-guided behavior and reward attitudes
in humans
\citep{lebreton2009automatic}.
NAc activity is further thought to reflect reward prediction signals
from dopaminergic neurotransmitter pathways
\citep{schultz1998predictive}
that not only channel action towards basic survival needs but also
enable more abstract reward processings, and thus perhaps RL,
in humans \citep{doherty2015structure}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  
  \includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{fig_dmn.png}
  \caption{\textbf{Predictive structural association between reward system and
      DMN nodes.} Reward tasks \citep{doherty2015structure} and neural processing in the DMN \citep{randy2008}, often considered task-negative, have been studied so far in largely separate niches of the neuroscience literature. A currently underappreciated link is however suggested here based on 9,932 human subjects from the UK Biobank, inter-individual differences in left NAc volume ($R^2=0.11 \pm 0.02$ [standard deviation across cross-validation folds]) and right NAc volume ($R^2=0.14 \pm 0.02$) could be predicted from (z-scored) volume in the DMN regions. These out-of-sample generalizations reflect the expected performance in yet-to-be observed individuals obtained from linear support vector regression applied to normalized region volumes in the DMN in a 10-fold cross-validation procedure \citep{hastie}.
    Consistent for the left and right reward system, NAc volume in a given subject is
    positively coupled with the vmPFC and HC. The congruence of our structural association results for both NAc targets speaks to the robustness of our pattern-prediction findings. The opposite relation of the left and right TPJ to the NAc appears to reflect a repeatedly recognized hemispheric asymmetry with respect to functional implications \citep{seghier2013angular}, impairments in neurological patients \citep{corbetta2000}, different types of connectivity \citep{uddin_tpj, caspers2011} as well as micro- and macroanatomy \citep{caspers2006, caspers2008}. The colors are indicative of the (\textcolor{red}{red} = positive,
    \textcolor{blue}{blue} = negative) and relative importance (the lighter the higher) of the regression coefficients.

\end{figure}

Consistently, diffusion MRI tractography in humans and monkeys
\citep{croxson2005quantitative}
quantified the NAc to
be more connected to the vmPFC than dmPFC in both species.
Two different functional connectivity analyses in humans also revealed
strong vmPFC connections
with the NAc, hippocampus (HC),
and PMC \citep{bzdok2015subspecialization}.
%
In line with these connectivity findings in animals and humans,
the vmPFC is often proposed to represent triggered
emotional and motivational states \citep{damasio1996somatic}.
Such real or imagined arousal states could be mapped in the vmPFC
as a bioregulatory disposition influencing cognition
and decision making.
In neuroeconomic studies of human decision making,
the vmPFC consistently reflects an individual’s subjective
value predictions
\citep{behrens2008associative}. This finding
may also explain why performance within and across participants
was reported to relate to state encoding in the vmPFC \citep{Schuck2016}.
Such a ``cognitive map'' of the action space - an integral part of a RL
agent -
was argued to encode
the current task state even when states are unobservable from
the sensory environment.

\subsection{The hippocampus: memory, space, and experience replay}
The DMN midline has close functional links
with the HC (henceforth implying to include also parahippocampal regions)
in the medial temporal lobe \citep{vincet2006, shannon2013morning} \textemdash
a region long known to be involved in
memory operations and spatial navigation in animals and humans.
While the HC
is traditionally believed to allow recalling past experience,
there is now increasing evidence for an important role
in constructing mental models in general
\citep{maguire2016, schacter2007remembering, gelbard2008internally, Javadi2017,
boyer2008evolutionary}.
Its recursive anatomical architecture
may be specifically designed to allow reconstructing
entire sequences of experience from memory fragments.
Indeed,
hippocampal damage was
not only associated with an impairment in re-experiencing the past (i.e., amnesia),
but also forecasting of one's own future and
imagination of experiences more broadly \citep{hassabis2007patients}.

Mental scenes created by neurological patients with HC lesion exposed a lack of
spatial integrity, richness in detail, and overall coherence (c.f ~\citep{hassabis2007patients}).
%
Single-cell recordings in the animal HC revealed
constantly active neuronal populations whose firing coincided with
specific locations in space during environmental navigation.
Indeed, when an animal is choosing between alternative
paths, the corresponding neuronal populations in the HC
spike one after another  \citep{johnson2007neural}.
Such neuronal patterns in the HC appear to directly indicate upcoming behavior,
such as in planning navigational trajectories
\citep{pfeiffer2013hippocampal} and
memory consolidation of choice relevance \citep{lavilleon2015}.
Congruently,
London taxi drivers, humans with high performance in forecasting spatial navigation,
were shown to exhibit increased gray-matter volume in the
HC \citep{maguire2000navigation}.


There is hence increasing evidence that
HC function extends beyond simple forms of
encoding and reconstruction of memory and space information.
Based on spike recordings of hippocampal neuronal populations,
complex spiking patterns can be followed across extended periods including
their modification of input-free self-generated patterns
after environmental events \citep{buzsaki2004large}.
Specific spiking sequences, which were elicited by experimental task design,
have been shown to be re-enacted spontaneously during
quiet wakefulness and sleep \citep{hartley2014space, o2010play}.
Moreover, neuronal spike sequences measured in hippocampal place cells of rats
featured re-occurrence directly after experimental trials
as well as directly before (prediction of) upcoming experimental trials \citep{diba2007forward}.
Similar spiking patterns in hippocampal neurons during rest and sleep
have been proposed to be critical in communicating local information
to the neocortex for long-term storage, potentially including DMN regions.
Moreover, in mice, invasively triggering spatial experience recall
in the HC during sleep
has been demonstrated to subsequently alter action choice during wakefulness
\citep{lavilleon2015}.
These HC-subserved mechanisms
conceivably contribute to advanced cognitive processes that require
re-experiencing or newly constructed mental scenarios,
such as in recalling autobiographical memory episodes
\citep{hassabis2007patients}.
Within a RL framework, the HC could thus orchestrate re-experience of environmental aspects for
consolidations based on re-enactment and for integration into
rich mental scene construction \citep{deuker2016event, bird2010establishing}.
In this way, the HC may impact
ongoing perception of and action on the environment
\citep{maguire2016, lavilleon2015}.

% such that it really occures in reality later.)


\subsection{The right and left TPJ: prediction error signaling and world semantics}
The DMN emerges with its midline structures early in human development
\citep{doria2010}, while
the right and left TPJs may become fully functionally integrated into this major brain
network only after birth.
The TPJs are known to exhibit hemispheric differences
based on microanatomical properties and cortical gyrification patterns
\citep{seghier2013angular}.
In general, neuroscientific investigations on hemispheric functional specialization
have highlighted the right cerebral hemisphere as more dominant for attentional functions
and the left side more for semantic functions
\citep{seghier2013angular, bzdok2013tpj, bzdok2016left,
stephan2007mechanisms}.



The TPJ in the right hemisphere (RTPJ) denotes a broad functional zone with
varying anatomical nomenclature \citep{marstpj2011, seghier2010, seghier2013angular}
that has been shown to be closely related to
multi-sensory prediction and prediction error signaling
\citep{downar2000multimodal, vetter2011, shulman2010, shulman2007}.
This DMN region is probably central for
action initiation during goal-directed psychological tasks and for
sensorimotor behavior by integrating multi-sensory attention
\citep{corbetta2002control}.
Its involvement was repeatedly reported in
multi-step action execution \citep{hartmann2005takes},
visuo-proprioceptive conflict \citep{Balslev2005},
spatial reorienting \citep{corbetta2000},
and
detection of environmental changes across
visual, auditory, or tactile stimulation
\citep{downar2000multimodal}.
Direct electrical stimulation of the human
RTPJ during neurosurgery was associated with altered perception
and stimulus awareness \citep{blanke2002neuropsychology}.
%
It was argued that the RTPJ encodes actions and predicted outcomes,
without necessarily relating these neural processes to value estimation
\citep{liljeholm2013neural, hamilton2008action,
jakobs2009effects}.
More specifically, neural activity in the RTPJ has been proposed to reflect
stimulus-driven attentional reallocation to
self-relevant and unexpected sources of information
as a ‘‘circuit breaker’’ that recalibrates functional control of brain networks
\citep{bzdok2013tpj, corbettashul2008}.
% (Bzdok et al., 2013; Corbetta et al., 2008).
% Indeed, neurological patients with RTPJ damage have particular difficulties
% with multi-step actions \citep{hartmann2005takes}.
In the face of large discrepancies between actual and previously predicted
environmental events, the RTPJ acts as a potential switch between
externally-oriented mind sets focussed on the
sensory environment and internally-oriented mind sets focussed
on mental scene construction.
For instance, temporally induced RTPJ damage in humans diminished the
impact of predicted intentions of other individuals
\citep{young2010disruption},
a capacity believed to be enabled by the DMN.
Viewed from a RL account,
the RTPJ might reflect an important relay that shifts away
from the ‘‘internally directed’’ baseline processes
to, instead, deal with unexpected environmental stimuli and events.
% (TODO: slow endogeneous changes in state transitions by the policy and value matrices)



The left TPJ of the DMN (LTPJ),
in turn, may have a functional relationship to Wernicke's area
involved in semantic processes \citep{blumenfeld_book} and has
been described as ``a temporoparietal transmodal gateway for language''
by some investigators \citep{mesulam_book}.
Neurological patients with damage in this region
have a major impairment of language comprehension
when listening to others or reading a book.
Patient speech
preserves natural rhythm and normal syntax, yet the
voiced sentences lack meaning (i.e., aphasia).
Abstracting from speech interpretations in linguistics
and neuropsychology,
the LTPJ appears to mediate access to and binding of world knowledge,
such as required during action considerations
\citep{binder2011neurobiology, seghier2013angular}.
Consistent with this view,
LTPJ damage in humans also entailed problems in recognizing
others' pantomimed action towards objects
without obvious relation to processing explicit language content
\citep{varney1987locus}.
% (Varney and Damasio 1987; Rothi et al. 1991; Buxbaum et al. 2005).
%
Inner speech also hinges on knowledge recall
about the physical and social world.
Indeed,
the internal production of
verbalized thought (``language of the mind'') was closely related to the LTPJ
in a pattern analysis of brain volume
\citep{geva2011neural}.
Further,
episodic memory recall and mental imagery to forecast future events strongly draw on
re-assembling world knowledge.
Isolated building blocks of world structure get rebuilt
in internally constructed mental scenarios that
guide present action choice,
weigh hypothetical possibilities, and forecast event outcomes.
%
As a candidate component of a RL agent,
neural processes in the LTPJ may
contribute to the automated predictions of the environment
by incorporating experience-derived building blocks of world regularities
into ongoing action, planning, and problem solving.

\section{Reinforcement learning control: a process model for DMN function}
We argue the outlined neurobiological properties
of the DMN regions
to be sufficient for implementing all components
of a full-fledged reinforcement learning (RL) system.
Recalling past experience, considering candidate actions,
random sampling of possible experiences, as well as
estimation of instantaneous and expected delayed reward outcomes
are key components of intelligent RL agents
that are plausible to functionally intersect in the DMN.



RL is an area of machine learning concerned with searching optimal behavioral strategies through interactions
with an \textit{environment} with the goal to maximize some \textit{cumulative reward}.
The optimal behavior typically
takes the future into account as some rewards could be \textit{delayed}.
Through repeated action on and feedback from the environment,
the agent learns how to reach goals and continuously improve the collection of reward signals
in a trial-and-error fashion (Fig. \ref{fig:rl}).
At a given moment, each taken \textit{action} $a$ triggers a change
in the \textit{state} of the environment
$s \rightarrow s'$, accompanied by environmental feedback signals as \textit{reward}
$r = r(s, a,s')$ obtained by the agent.
If the collected reward outcome yields a negative value it can be
more naturally interpreted as \textit{punishment}.
In this setting, the environment is partially controlled by
the action of the agent and the reward can be thought
of as satisfaction \textemdash or aversion \textemdash that accompany the execution of
a particular action.
% Action may be delayed to achieve substantial increases in expected reward
% that is expected to grow with time.



The environment is generally taken as \textit{stochastic},
that is, changing in random ways. In addition, the environment is only
\textit{partially observable} in the sense that only limited aspects of the environment's
state are accessible to the agent's sensory input
\citep{starkweather2017dopamine}.
We assume that volatility of the environment
is realistic in a computational model which sets out
to explain DMN functions of the human brain.
% XXX: the following passage is already in the introduction
% Indeed, it is known that the more the external world is predictable,
% the more mental activity becomes detached from the actual sensory inputs
% \citep{antrobus1966studies, pope1978regulation},
% the more stimulus-independent thoughts occur, and
% the higher the neural activity in the DMN.
% Conversely, the more the currently executed task is unknown and unpracticed,
% the lower the DMN activity
% \citep{filler1973daydreaming, teasdale1995stimulus}.
% %
% These ``offline'' processes may however contribute to
% optimizing control of the organism.
% Such a framework of DMN funtion based on reinforcement learning
% can naturally embed human behavior
% in the tension between exploitative action with immediate gains and
% explorative action with longer-term reward schedules
% \citep{dayan2008decision}.
We argue that a functional account of the DMN based on RL
can naturally embed human behavior
in the tension between exploitative action with immediate gains and
explorative action with longer-term reward outcomes
\citep{dayan2008decision}.
In short, DMN implication in a diversity of
particularly sophisticated human behaviors
can be parsimoniously explained as instantiating probabilistic
simulations of experience coupled with prediction error minimization
to calibrate action trajectories for
reward outcome maximization at different time scales.
Such a purposeful optimization objective
may be subserved by a stochastic approximation
based on a brain implementation for Monte Carlo sampling of events and outcomes.

\subsection{Markov decision processes}
RL has had considerable success in modeling many real-world problems, including super-human performance in complex video games \citep{mnih2015},
robotics \citep{ng2004,abbeel2004},
and strategic board games like the breakthrough results upon recently on the game of Go \citep{silver2016mastering} considered to be a milestone benchmark in artificial intelligence.
% We emphasize that the brain in general, and the DMN in particular,
% is a physical system governed by the laws of
% physics and can be formally described
% by Markov processes at a sufficiently coarse scale.
% It has indeed been previously proposed \citep{tegmark2016improved} that
% any system obeying the laws of classical physics can be accurately modeled as a Markov process as long as the time
% step is sufficiently short.
In artificial intelligence and machine learning, a popular computational model for
multi-step decision processes in such an environment are
MDPs \citep{sutton1998reinforcement}.
% For the remainder of this paper, for the sake of simplicity
% we use the abbreviation ``MDP'' to refer to the special case
% of \textit{Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes}.
An MDP operationalizes a sequential decision process
in which it is assumed that environment dynamics are determined by a Markov process,
but the agent cannot directly observe the underlying state.
Instead, the agent tries to optimize a \textit{subjective} reward
signal (i.e., likely to be different for another agent in the same state),
by maintaining probability distributions over actions according to their expected utility.
% This is performed alongside each transition in the state space of the environment
%  and maintains a probability distribution over the set of possible
% states.
% % , based on a set of observations and observation probabilities.
This is a minimal set of assumptions that can be made about an environment faced by an agent engaged in interactive learning.

\begin{definition*}
Mathematically, an MDP is simply a quintuplet $(\mathcal S, \mathcal A, r, p)$ where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathcal S$ is the set of states, such as $\mathcal S = \{\text{happy}, \text{sad}, \text{puzzeled}\}$.
\item $\mathcal A$ is the set of actions, such as $\mathcal A = \{\text{read}, \text{run},
  \text{laugh}, \text{sympathize}, \text{empathize}\}.$
\item $r : \mathcal S \times \mathcal A \times \mathcal S \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is the \textit{reward function},
   so that $r(s, a, s')$ is the instant reward for taking action $a$ in state $s$ followed by a state-transition $s \rightarrow s'$.
% \item $\mu: \mathcal S \rightarrow [0, 1]$ is the prior probability on the states so that
%   $\mu(s)$ is the probability that the environment starts off in state $s$.
\item $p : \mathcal S \times \mathcal A \times \mathcal S \rightarrow [0, 1],\; (s,a,s') \mapsto p(s'|s,a)$,
  the probability of moving to state $s'$ if action $a$ is taken from state $s$. In addition, one requires that such
  transitions be Markovian. Consequently, the future states are independent of past states and only depend on the present state and action taken.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition*}

% , defining $s(t)$, the state at time $t$, as the position in state space.
The process has $memory$ if the subsequent state depends not only on the current state but also on a number of past states. Rational probabilistic planning can thus be reformulated as a standard memoryless Markov process by simply expanding the definition of the state $s$ to include experience episodes of the past. This extension adds the capacity for memory to the model because the next state then depends not only on the current situation but also on previously experienced events, which is the motivation behind Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs)
\citep{starkweather2017dopamine,o2006making}.
Nevertheless, this mathematical property of POMDPs mostly accounts for implicit $memory$. Since the current paper is concerned with plausibility at the behavioral and neurobiological level, we will address below how our account can accommodate the neurophysiological constraints of the DMN and the explicit $memory$ characteristics of human agents.

\paragraph*{Why Markov Decision Processes?} One may wonder whether MDP models
are applicable to something as complex as human behavior. This class of
reinforcement-learning models has had numerous successes in diverse domains. For instance, financial trading is largely a manifestation of strategic decision-making of interacting human agents. According to how the market responds, the agent incurs gain or loss as environmental feedback of the executed financial actions. Recent research on automatizing market exchanges by algorithmic trading has effectively deployed MDPs as a framework for modeling these elaborate behavioral dynamics  ~\citep{brazdil2017,yang15,yang14,yang12,dempster2006,hult2010, abergel2017}.
%
MDPs have also been effective as a behavioral model in robotics
\citep{ng2004,abbeel2004} and in challenging multistep strategy games
~\citep{mnih2015,silver2016mastering,pritzel2017neural}. 
More recent work has
developped an MDP-based way of reasoning about future behavior
of other agents \citep{robinowitz2018}.
The idea is to use meta-learning (learning to learn) to build strong priors
about the behavior of of a population of other agents.

% As such, we aim to expand MDP applications as a useful model from "online" decision-making to the realms of "offline" behaviors most associated with the DMN.


% Indeed a critique could argue that Markov chains are state-machines without memory. These may describe insects, or other behaviorally primitive beings like ATM machines, insects, etc., but won't be sufficient to describe human beings, as for example, human behavior is heavily influenced not only by the current state but by past states as well (memory).

% \paragraph*{Answer:}
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item First, let us emphasize that the brain in general, and the DMN in particular,
% is a physical system governed by the laws of

% step is sufficiently short.



% \end{itemize}


\paragraph*{Reinforcement learning in the brain.}
RL can be plausibly realized in the human brain \citep{doherty2015structure, daw2014algorithmic}.
Indeed,
previous authors have proposed
\citep{gershman2015computational} that a core property of human intelligence is the improvement
of expected utility outcomes as a strategy for action choice in uncertain
environments, a situation perfectly captured by the formalism of MDPs.
It has also long been proposed \citep{dayan2008decision} that there
can be a mapping between algorithmic aspects
underlying model-free and model-based RL learning
and neurobiological aspects underlying brain function.
The neurotransmitter dopamine could serve
as a 'teaching signal' to better estimate value associations
and action policies by modulating
synaptic plasticity in the reward-processing circuitry, including the NAc.
In contrast, model-based RL would start off with some mechanistic assumptions about the dynamics of the world.
These can be assumptions about the physical laws governing the agent's environment or constraints on the state space, transition probabilities between states,
reward contingencies, etc.
% For instance, if a rat in a maze knows
% that standing still will produce no change in the environment, and in particular will not eventually lead to finding the food.
An agent might represent such knowledge about the world as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $r(s, \text{``stand still''}) = 0$ if $s$ does not correspond to a location
offering relevant resources.
\item $p(s'|s,\text{``stand still''}) = 1$ if $s'=s$ and $0$ otherwise.
\item etc.
\end{itemize}
% Model-based assumes knowledge of the environment in terms of the transition probabilities between states, the reward contingencies for state-action pairs, or any form of representation of the environment.
Such knowledge can be partly extracted from the environment: the agent infers a model of the world while learning to take optimal decisions based on the current representation of the environment. These methods learn what the effect is going to be of taking a particular action in a particular state. The result is an estimate of the underlying MDP which can then be either solved exactly or approximately, depending on the setting and what is feasible.

% In contrast, model-free methods require no pre-specified knowledge of the environment (transition probabilities, types of sensory input, etc.) or representation thereof. The agent infers which state-action pairs lead to reward through sampling the world in a trial-and-error manner and derives longer-term reward aggregates using environmental feedback information as an incentive. In so doing, model-free agents ultimately learn both an action policy and an implicit representations of the world. This distinction between model-free and model-based RL is similar to previous views \citep{dayan2014}.

% In terms of number of states, model-based RL scales better than model-free RL; in terms of the time horizon, model-free RL scales better~\citep{strehl2006}. Drawing from a vast literature, we will show that the DMN contains sufficient neurobiological hardware to implement model-free RL, at least in principle.



\subsubsection{Accumulated rewards and policies}
The behavior of the agent is governed by a \textit{policy}, which maps states of the world
to probability distributions over candidate actions.
Starting at time $t=0$,
following a policy $\pi$ generates a trajectory of action choices:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \begin{split}
    \textbf{choose action: }a_0 &\sim \pi(a|s_0)\\
    \textbf{ observe transition: }s_1 &\sim p(s|s_0,a_0)\textbf{ and collect
      reward }R_0 = r(s_0, a_0, s_1)\\
    \textbf{choose action: }a_1 &\sim \pi(a|s_1)\\
    \textbf{ observe transition: }s_2 &\sim p(s|s_1,a_1), \textbf{ and collect
      reward }R_1 = r(s_1, a_1,s_2)\\
    \vdots\\
    \textbf{choose action: }a_{t} &\sim \pi(a|s_{t})\\
    \textbf{ observe transition: }s_{t+1} &\sim p(s|s_{t},a_{t}), \textbf{ and
      collect reward }R_{t} = r(s_{t}, a_{t},s_{t+1})\\
    \vdots
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray*}
We assume time invariance
in that we expect the dynamics of the process
to be equivalent over sufficiently long time windows of equal length (i.e., stationarity).
Since an action executed in the present moment might have repercussions in the
far future, it turns out that the quantity to optimize is not the instantaneous
rewards $r(s, a)$, but a \textit{cumulative reward} estimate which takes into
account expected reward from action choices in the future. A common approach to
modeling this gathered outcome is the time-discounted cumulative reward% function
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cumr}
  G^\pi = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\gamma^{t}R_t = R_0 + \gamma R_1 + \gamma^2 R_2 + \ldots + \gamma^tR_t + \ldots
\end{equation}
This random variable
  \footnote{Random as it depends both on the environment's dynamics and the
  policy $\pi$ being executed. The exponential delay discounting function used
  here refers to the usual formulation in the field of reinforcement learning,
  although psychological experiments may also reveal other discounting regimes
  \citep{green2004discounting}.}
measures the cumulative reward of
following an action policy $\pi$.
%
Note that value buffering may be realized in the vmPFC by virtue of
this region's connections to the NAc of the reward sytem
\citep{carlezon2009}.




The goal of the RL agent is then to successively update this action policy in order
to maximize $G^\pi$ on average (cf. below). In \eqref{eq:cumr},
the definition of cumulative reward $G^\pi$,
the constant $\gamma$ $(0 \le \gamma < 1$) is the \textit{reward discount factor},
viewed to be characteristic for a certain agent.
On the one hand,
setting $\gamma = 0$ yields perfectly hedonistic behavior.
An agent with such a shortsighted time horizon is exclusively
concerned with immediate rewards.
This is however not compatible with coordinated planning of longer-term agendas that is
potentially subserved by neural activity in the DMN.
% \footnote{In which case we can take $T \rightarrow +\infty$, provided the reward function $r$ is bounded.}.
% The reward discount factor
On the other hand,
setting $0 < \gamma < 1$ allows a learning process to arise.
A positive $\gamma$ can be seen as calibrating risk-seeking trait of the intelligent agent,
that is, the behavioral predispositions related to trading longer delays
for higher reward outcomes.
Such an agent puts relatively more emphasis on rewards expected in
a more distant future.
Concretely,
rewards that are not expected to occur only within
% \footnote{\textbf{N.B.:} $\frac{1}{1-\gamma} = 1 + \gamma + \gamma^2 + \gamma^3 + \ldots$}
a very large number of
time steps from the present point are ignored.
The complexity reduction by time discounting
alleviates the variance of expected rewards accumulated across
considered action cascades by limiting the depth of the search tree.
Given that there is more uncertainty in the far future,
it is important to appreciate that a stochastic policy estimation
is more advantageous in many RL settings.
% For instance, a deterministic strategy in playing rock-paper-scissors can
% be easily exploited and a uniformly random choice is optimal.

\subsection{The components of reinforcement learning in the DMN}
Given only the limited information available from an MDP, at a state $s$ the average
utility of choosing an action $a$ under a policy $\pi$ can be captured by the single number
% We can now formulate the purpose of the DMN
% as finding a policy $\pi$ for the human agent that maximizes the
% expected cumulative value of an state-action pair $(a,s)$, also known as the \textit{Q-value}, namely
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qval}
  Q^{\pi}(s,a) = \mathbb E [G^\pi|s_0=s,a_0=a],
\end{equation}
called the $Q$-value for the state-action pair $(s,a)$.
In other words, $Q^{\pi}(s,a)$ corresponds to the expected reward
over all considered action trajectories, in which
the agent sets out in the environment in state
$s$, chooses action $a$, and then follows the policy $\pi$ to select future actions.
%% Given that each $\pi$ correspondence to an exhaustive description of
%% behavioral patterns, $Q^{\pi}(s_t,a_t)$ corresponds to the epistemic value of
%% the set of actions given states in finite time.
For the brain,
$Q^{\pi}(s, a)$ defined in \eqref{eq:qval} provides the subjective
utility of executing a specific action.
It thus answers the question
``What is the expected utility of choosing action $a$, and its ramifications, in this situation?''.
$Q^{\pi}(s,a)$ offers a formalization of optimal behavior that
may well capture such processing aspects subserved by the DMN in human agents.

% One can also define the state-value function

% \begin{eqnarray}
%   \V^\pi(s) := \mathbb E_{a \sim \pi}Q^\pi(s,a) = \mathbb E [G^\pi|s_0=s],
% \end{eqnarray}
% which measures the value of each state $s \in \mathcal S$ under the policy $\pi$. This serves
% as a baseline value for any action. Finally, the advantage function is defined by
% \begin{equation}
% A^\pi(s,a) :=  Q^\pi(s,a) - V^\pi(s).
% \end{equation}

% The goal of the DMN is then
% to find then to produce a policy $\pi$ which maximizes the expected cumulative reward $Q^\pi(s_0,\pi(a_0))$
% given an initial state $s_0$.

% \subsection{Efficient computation of optimal behavior}
% By construction, maximizing the expectation in  \eqref{eq:qval} is computationally intractable in general.
% This is due to the enormous number of possible action
% trajectories that the agent often needs to
% consider simultaneously.
% % \begin{mdframed}
% %   \textbf{N.B.:}
% %   If the Bellman-based computational ideas have a corresponding
% %   neurobiological implementation, this provides a framework of how
% %   optimal behavior could be computable in the human brain.
% % \end{mdframed}
% One popular solution is called \text{Q-learning}. It remedies
% the issue by only considering the sub-family of
% \textit{deterministic policies}, which map each state to the single best action to
% take at the current state. Such policies define deterministic functions from states to actions.

% \subsubsection{The Bellman equation:  characterizing optimal behavior}
% Q-learning (Watkins \& Dayan, 1992) generates a
% \textit{greedy policy}
\subsubsection{Optimal behavior and the Bellman equation}

Optimal behavior of the agent corresponds to
a strategy $\pi^*$ for choosing actions such that, for every state, the chosen action guarantees the best possible reward on average. Formally,
% \textbf{XXX please add 1-2 sentences why this is interesting in the current
% context. This statement appears a little alone as it stands.}
\begin{equation}
  \pi^*(s) := \argmax_{a \in \mathcal A}{Q}^*(s, a),\text{ where }Q^*(s, a) := \max_{\pi}Q^\pi(s,a).
  \label{eq:qlearning}
\end{equation}
The learning goal is to approach the
policy $\pi^*$ as close as possible, that is to \text{solve} the MDP.
Note that \eqref{eq:qlearning} presents merely a definition and
does not lend itself as a candidate schema
for solving MDPs with even moderately sized action and state spaces
(i.e., intractability).
% where $\tilde{Q}(s, a)$ is the current estimate of the state-action value
% table.
Fortunately, the \textit{Bellman equation} \citep{sutton1998reinforcement} provides a fixed-point relation which defines $Q^*$ implicitly via a sampling procedure, without querying the entire space of policies, with the form
\begin{equation}
  Q^* = \text{Bel}(Q^*),
  \label{eq:bellman}
\end{equation}
where the so-called Bellman transform $\text{Bel}(Q)$
of an arbitrary $Q$-value function $Q: \mathcal S \times \mathcal A \rightarrow \mathbb R$  is another $Q$-value function defined by
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
   \text{Bel}(Q)(s,a) &:=
   \mathbb E_{s' \sim p(s'|s,a)} [r(s,a) + \gamma \max_{a' \in \mathcal A}Q(s', a')]\\
   &= r(s,a) + \gamma\mathbb E_{s' \sim p(s'|s,a)} [\max_{a' \in \mathcal A}Q(s', a')]\\
   &= \text{instantaneous reward} + \text{expected reward for acting greedily thereafter}
%    \; \forall (s,a) \in \mathcal S \times \mathcal A
    % \\&=
    % \mathbb E_{s' \sim p(s'|s,a)} [r(s,a) + \gamma Q^*(s', \pi^*(s'))].
    \end{split}
  \end{equation}

The Bellman equation \eqref{eq:bellman} is a temporal consistency equation which provides
a dynamic decomposition of optimal behavior by dividing the $Q$-value function into the immediate
reward and the discounted rewards of the upcoming states.
The optimal Q-value operator $Q^*$ is a fixed point for this equation.
As a consequence of this outcome stratification, the complicated dynamic programming
problem \eqref{eq:qlearning}
is broken down into simpler sub-problems at different time points.
Indeed,
exploitation of hierarchical structure in action considerations
has previously been related to the medial prefrontal part of the DMN
\citep{koechlin1999role, braver2002role}.
Using the Bellman equation, each state can be associated with a certain value
to guide action towards a preferred state, thus improving on the
current action policy of the agent.
% It is a fixed-point equation for the deterministic policy $\pi$.
Note that in \eqref{eq:bellman} the random sampling
is performed only over quantities which
depend on the environment.
This aspect of the learning process
can unroll off-policy by observing state transitions
triggered by another (possibly stochastic) behavioral policy.

% \subsection{Learning in the DMN}
\subsubsection{Value approximation and the policy matrix}
\label{sec:policymat}
As already mentioned in the previous section, Q-learning~\citep{watkins92} optimizes over the class of
deterministic policies of the form \eqref{eq:qlearning}. State spaces may be extremely large
and tracking all possible states and actions may require prohibitively excessive
computation and memory resources.
The need of maintaining an explicit table of
states can be eliminated by instead using of an approximate $Q$-value function $\tilde{Q}(s,a|\theta)$
by keeping track of an approximating parameter $\theta$ of much lower dimension than the number of states.
At a given time step, the world is in a state $s \in \mathcal S$, and the agent takes an
action which it expects to be the most valuable on average, namely

\begin{equation}
  \pi^{\text{hard-max}}(s) = \argmax_{a \in \mathcal A}\tilde{Q}(s, a|\theta).
  \label{eq:policy}
\end{equation}
This defines a mapping from states directly to actions.
% $a \mapsto \tilde{Q}(a,s|\theta)$ of the $Q$-value function ``frozen'' at state $s$.
For instance, a simple linear model with a kernel $\phi$ would be of the
form $\tilde{Q}(s, a|\theta) = \phi(s,a)^T\theta$, where
$\phi(s,a)$ would represent a high-level representation of the state-action pairs
$(s,a)$, as was previously proposed \citep{songNIPS2016},
or artificial neural-network models as demonstrated in recent
seminal investigations
\citep{mnih2015,silver2016mastering} for playing complex games (atari, Go, etc.) at super-human levels.
%  and Parr et al. 2003 (JMLR)].
In the DMN, the dmPFC would implement such a hard-max lookup
over the action space.
The model
parameters $\theta$ would correspond to synaptic weights and connection strengths within and between
brain regions. It is a time-varying neuronal program which dictates how to move from world states $s$ to actions $a$ via the hard-max policy \eqref{eq:policy}.
The approximating $Q$-value function $\tilde{Q}(s, a|\theta)$ would inform the DMN with the (expected) usefulness of choosing an action $a$ in state $s$.
The DMN, and in particular its dmPFC part, could then contribute to the choice, at a given state $s$, of an action $a$ which maximizes the approximate
$Q$-values.
This mapping from states to actions that is conventionally called
\textit{policy matrix} \citep{mnih2015,silver2016mastering}.
Learning consists in starting from a given table and
updating it during action choices,
which take the agent to different table entries.


% An additional layer of learning concerns the addition of new entries in the table (i.e., state and action). The framing of the policy matrix is not described here but could be supported by synaptic epigenesis \citep{gisiger_acquisition_2005}. Indeed, the tuning of synaptic weights through learning can stabilize additional patterns of activity by
% creating new attractors in the neural dynamics landscape \citep{takeuchi_synaptic_2014}. Those attractors will then constrain both
% the number of factors taken into account by decision processes and the number of behaviors at reach by the agent \citep{wang_decision_2008}.

% \subsubsection{Bounded rationality}
% $$\max_{a \in \mathcal A}\tilde{Q}(s, a|\theta)  \propto \lim_{T \rightarrow 0^+}\exp(\tilde{Q}(s,a|\theta)/T)$$

  \subsubsection{Self-training and the loss function}
  \label{sec:self}
Successful learning in brains and computer algorithms may not be possible without a
defined learning goal \textemdash the \textit{loss function}.
The action $a$ chosen in state $s$ according to the policy matrix defined in
\eqref{eq:policy} yields a reward $r$ collected by the agent,
% (measured on their internal currency of worldly values ?),
after which the environment transitions to a new state $s' \in \mathcal S$.
% \textbf{XXX Please try to smoothen the previous sentence}
One such cycle yields a new \textit{experience} $e = (s,a,r,s')$.
Each cycle represents a behavior unit of the agent
and is recorded in replay memory buffer \textemdash
which we hypothesize to be subserved by the
HC \textemdash, possibly discarding the oldest entries to make space:
$\mathcal D \leftarrow \text{append}(\mathcal D, e)$.
At time step $k$, the agent seeks an update $\theta_{k} \leftarrow \theta_{k-1}
+ \delta \theta_{k}$ of the parameters for its approximate model of the
$Q$-value function. Step-by-step model parameter updates warrant a learning process and definition of a loss
function. % \subsubsection{Stochastic gradient in the DMN via experience replay}
The Bellman equation \eqref{eq:bellman} provides a way to obtain such a loss
function \eqref{eq:oracle} as we outline in the following.
% A practically successful RL approach
% needs ways to efficiently approximate the state-action value function
% to allow for scaling to large state and action spaces.
Experience replay consists in sampling
% (uniform or importance-weighted
% \footnote{e.g weighted by TD error of the state transition $s \overset{a}{\rightarrow} s'$.})
batches of experiences $e$
$(s, a, r, s') \sim \mathcal D$ from the replay memory $\mathcal D$.
The agent then tries to approximate
the would-be $Q$-value for the state-action pair $(s,a)$ as predicted by the
Bellman equation \eqref{eq:bellman}, namely
\begin{equation}
  y_k := y_k(s,a,s') =  r + \gamma \max_{a'} \tilde{Q}(s', a'|\theta_{k-1}),
\end{equation}
with the estimation of a parametrized regression model $(s,a)
\mapsto \tilde{Q}(s, a|\theta_{k-1})$.
From a neurobiological perspective, experience replay can be manifested as the
re-occurrence of neuron spiking sequences that have also been measured during
specific prior actions or environmental states. The HC is a strong candidate
for contributing to such neural reinstantiation of behavioral episodes as
neuroscience experiments have repeatedly indicated in rats, mice, cats, rabbits,
songbirds, and monkeys \citep{buhry2011,nokia2010,dave2000,skaggs2007}. Refer to
Fig. \ref{fig:rl_process_chart}.

At the current step $k$, computing an optimal parameter update then corresponds to
finding the model parameters $\theta_{k}$ which minimize the following mean-squared loss function
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal L(\theta^Q_{k})
  % = \mathbb E_{(s, a, r, s') \sim \mathcal D}[(\tilde{Q}(s, a|\theta) - \tilde{Q}(s',a'|\theta^Q_{k}))^2]
  = \mathbb E_{(s, a, r, s') \sim \mathcal D}\left[\frac{1}{2}(\tilde{Q}(s, a|\theta_{k}) - y_k)^2\right],
  \label{eq:oracle}
\end{equation}
where $y_k$ is obtained from \eqref{eq:bellman}.
% \textbf{We still may need to explain y in the formula with one sentence.}
A recently proposed, practically successful alternative approach is to learn this
representation using an artificial deep neural-network model. This approach leads to the
so-called \textit{deep Q-learning}~\citep{mnih2015,silver2016mastering} family of methods which
is the current state-of-the-art in RL research.
The set of model parameters $\theta$ that instantiate the non-linear interactions
between layers of the artificial neural network
may find a neurobiological correspondence in the adaptive strengths of axonal
connections between neurons from the different levels
of the neural processing hierarchy
\citep{mesulam1998sensation, taylor2015global}.

\paragraph*{A note on bias in self-training.}
Some bias may be introduced by self-training due to information shortage caused by the absence of external stimulation.
 One way to address this issue is using importance sampling to replay especially those state-transitions from which there is more to learn for the agent \citep{schaul2015, hessel2017}. New transitions are inserted into the replay buffer with maximum priority, thus shifting emphasis to more recent transitions. Such insertion strategy would help counterbalance the bias introduced by the information shortage incurred by absent external input. Other authors noticed \citep{hessel2017} that such prioritized replay reduces the data complexity and the agent shows faster increases in learning performance.


\subsubsection{Optimal control via stochastic gradient descent in the DMN}
Efficient learning of the entire set of model parameters can effectively be achieved
via stochastic \textit{gradient descent}, a universal algorithm for finding
local minima based on the first derivative of the optimization objective.
Stochastic here means that the gradient is estimated from batches of training samples,
which here corresponds to blocks of experience from the replay memory:

% online stochastic gradient descent is used to minimize the variational objective
% \eqref{eq:oracle}.

% \paragraph{Parameter update.}
\begin{equation}
  \delta= -\alpha_k \nabla_{\theta_{k}}\mathcal L(\theta_{k})
  = -\alpha_k\mathbb E_{(s, a, r, s') \sim \mathcal D}[\underbrace{(\tilde{Q}(s, a|\theta_{k}) - y_k)}_{\text{prediction error}}
    \underbrace{\nabla_{\theta_{k}}\tilde{Q}(s, a|\theta_{k})}_{\text{aversion}}],
  \label{eq:oracle}
\end{equation}
where the positive constants $\alpha_1, \alpha_2,\ldots$ are learning rates.
Thus, the subsequent action is taken to drive reward prediction errors
to percolate from lower to higher processing layers to modulate the
choice of future actions. It is known that under special conditions on the learning rates $\alpha_k$ --namely that the learning rates are neither too large nor too small, or more precisely that the sum $\sum_{k=0}^\infty\alpha_k$ diverges while $\sum_{k=0}^\infty\alpha_k^2$--
the thus generated approximating sequence of $Q$-value functions
% \footnote{The proof is standard and relies on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied to the Bellman transform.}
$$\tilde{Q}(.,.|\theta_0) \rightarrow \tilde{Q}(.,.|\theta_1) \rightarrow \tilde{Q}(.,.|\theta_2) \rightarrow \ldots$$
are attracted and absorbed by the optimal $Q$-value function $Q^*$ defined implicitly by the Bellman equation \eqref{eq:bellman}.

% \paragraph{Link to classical reinforcement learning.}
% One should note that most classical RL algorithms, including \textit{Temporal Difference (TD)}
% learning \citep{sutton1998reinforcement}, REINFORCE \citep{williams1992}, and SARSA can be
% cast in the general variational framework \eqref{eq:oracle}. For instance, TD corresponds to
% the above framework using a linear value approximator with feature encoding
% $\phi(s,a) = \delta_{(s,a)} =  \text{ point mass at }(s,a)$ on the grid
% $\mathcal S \times \mathcal A$, and so
% $$\nabla_{\theta}\tilde{Q}(s, a|\theta) = \phi(s, a) = \delta_{(s,a)}.$$
% Hence, the gradient update due to the sample $(s,a,r,s') \in \mathcal D$ is
% $$\tilde{Q}(s, a) \leftarrow \tilde{Q}(s, a) + \alpha(y-\tilde{Q}(s, a)),$$
% the well-known TD update rule \citep{sutton1998reinforcement}.

\subsubsection{Does the hippocampus subserve Monte Carlo sampling?}
In RL, Monte Carlo simulation is a common means to update the agent's belief state
based on stochastic sampling around states and possible transitions \citep{daw2014algorithmic,silver2010monte}.
Monte Carlo simulation provides a simple method for evaluating the value of a state.
This inference procedure provides an effective mechanism both for tree search (of the considered
action trajectories)
and for belief state updates, breaking the curse of dimensionality and allowing much greater scalability than a RL agent without stochastic resampling procedures.
Such methods have scaling as a function of available data (i.e., sample complexity) that
is determined only by the underlying difficulty of the MDP, rather than the size of the state space or observation space,
which can be prohibitively large.

In the human brain,
the HC could contribute to synthesizing imagined sequences of world states,
actions and rewards \citep{aronov2017, chao2017interaction, boyer2008evolutionary}.
These simulations of experience batches
would be used to update the value function, without ever looking inside the black box describing the model's dynamics.
A brain-imaging experiment in humans for instance identified hippocampal signals that specifically preceded upcoming choice performance in prospective planning in new environments
\citep{kaplan2017neural}.
It would be a simple strategy to evaluate
all legal actions and selecting the action with
highest expected cumulative rewards.
In MDPs, MC simulation provides an effective mechanism both for tree search and for belief-based state updates, breaking the curse of dimensionality and allowing much greater scalability than has previously been possible \citep{silver2016mastering}.
This is because expected consequences of action choices can be well evaluated although only a subset of the states are actually considered \citep{daw2014algorithmic}.
% Much recent work points to MCMC or stochastic sampling-based approximations as a unifying framework for understanding how Bayesian inference may work practically across all these levels, in minds, brains, and machines. \textbf{XXX elvis: refs needed in last sentence. Plus, should be really bring up Bayesian?}

\paragraph*{A note on implicit and explicit memory.}
While Markov processes are usually memoryless, it is mathematically feasible to
incorporate the previous states of such model into the current state. This
extension may partially account for implicit memory at the behavioral level, but
may not explain the underlying neurobiological implementation or accommodate
explicit memory. Implicit memory-based processing arises in our MDP account of
DMN function in several different forms: successive updates of a) the action
policy and the value function, both being products of the past, as well as b)
the deep non-linear relationships within the hierarchical connections of
biological neural networks. The brain's adaptive synaptic connections can be
thought as a deep neural-network architecture affording an implicit form of
information compression of life experience. Such memory traces are stored in the
neural machinery and can be implicitly retrieved as a form of knowledge during
simulation of action rather than accessed as a stored explicit representation
\citep{pezzulo2011grounding}. c) Certain neural processes in the hippocampus can
be seen as some type of Monte Carlo sampling for memory recall, which can also
be a basis for probabilistic simulations across time scales
\citep{schacter2007remembering,Axelrod2017}.


\subsection{Putting everything together}

The DMN is today known to consistently increase in neural
activity when humans engage in cognitive processes that are relatively detached from
the current sensory environment.
The more familiar and predictable the current environment, the more brain resources may remain for allocating DMN activity to MDP processes extending beyond the present time and sensory context.
%
This speculation receives quantitative support in that connectional links between
nodes of the DMN have been reported to be more consistent and reliable than
functional couplings within any other macroscopical networks \citep{shehz2009}.
As such, random-sampling-related baseline evaluation of possibilities and
events may be subserved by the DMN and get partly suspended when novelty in
the external environment is encountered or immediate action is required.
%
In line with this perspective, DMN engagement was shown to heighten and relate to effective behavioral responses in the practiced phase of a demanding cognitive flexibility task, as compared to acquisition phase when participants learned context-specific rules. This involvement in automated decision-making has led the authors to propose an ``autopilot'' role for the DMN \citep{vatansever2017pnas}, which may contribute to optimizing intervention of the organism on the world in general. Among all parts of the DMN, the RTPJ is perhaps the most evident candidate for a network-switching relay that calibrates between processing of environment-engaged versus internally generated information \citep{downar2000multimodal, golland2006extrinsic, bzdok2013tpj}.


Additionally,
the DMN was proposed to be situated
at the top of the brain network hierarchy, with
the subordinate salience and dorsal attention network in the middle and
the primary sensory cortices at the bottom
\citep{carhart2010default, margulies2016situating}.
Its putative involvement in thinking about 
hypothetical experiences and future outcomes
appears to tie in with the implicit computation of
action and state cascades as a function of
experienced events and collected feedback from the past.
A policy matrix encapsulates the choice probabilities of possible actions
on the world given a current situation (i.e., state).
The DMN may subserve
  constant exploration of candidate action trajectories and
  nested estimaton of their
  cumulative reward outcomes. Implicit computation of future choices
  provides a potential explanation for the
  evolutionary emergence and practical usefulness of
  mind-wandering at day-time and dreams during sleep
  in humans.


\paragraph*{Neural correlates of the Bellman equation in the DMN (Humans)}
Relating decomposition of consecutive action choices by the Bellman equation
to neuroscientific insights,
specific neural activity in the dorsal prefrontal cortex (BA9)
was linked to processing ``goal-tree sequences''
in human brain-imaging experiments
\citep{koechlin1999role, koechlin2000dissociating}.
Sub-goal exploration may require multi-task switching
between cognitive processes
as later parts of a solution
frequently depend on respective earlier steps in a given solution path, which
necessitates storage of expected intermediate outcomes.
As such,
``cognitive branching'' operations for nested processing of behavioral strategies
are likely to
entail secondary reallocation of attention and working-memory resources.
Further brain-imaging experiments corroborated
the prefrontal DMN to subserve
``processes related to the management and monitoring of sub-goals while
maintaining information in working memory''
\citep{braver2002role}
and to functionally couple with the hippocampus conditioned by ``deep versus shallow planning''
\citep{kaplan2017neural}.
%
Moreover,
neurological patients with lesions in this DMN region were reported
to be impaired in aspects of realizing ``multiple sub-goal scheduling''
\citep{burgess2000cognitive}.
Hence,
the various advanced human abilities subserved by the DMN, such as
planning and abstract reasoning, can be viewed to involve some form of
action-decision branching to enable higher-order executive control.

We hypothesize a functional dissociation between computations pertaining to action policy versus adapting stimulus-value associations as we expect implementation in different subsystems of the DMN. First, we expect that fMRI signals in the right temporo-parietal junction relate to behavioral changes subsequent to adaptation in the action choice tendencies (policy matrix) involved in non-value-related prediction error. Second, fMRI signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex should relate to behavioral changes following adaptation in value estimation (value matrix) due to reward-related stimulus-value association. We finally expect that fMRI signals in the posteromedial cortex, as a potential global information integrator, are related to shifts in overt behavior based on previous adaptations in both policy or value estimation.

\paragraph*{Continuous learning paradigm (Humans)} We hypothesize a functional relationship between the DMN closely associated with the occurrence of stimulus-independent thoughts and the reward circuitry. During an iterative neuroeconomic two-player game, fMRI signals in the DMN could be used to predict reward-related signals in the nucleus accumbens across trials in a continuous learning paradigm. We expect that the more DMN activity is measured to be increased, supposedly the higher the tendency for stimulus-independent thoughts, the more the fMRI signals in the reward circuits should be independent of the reward context in the current sensory environment.

\paragraph*{Temporal discounting experiment (Humans)} We hypothesize that the relevant time horizon is modulated by various factors such as age, acute stress and time-enduring impulsivity traits
\citep{luksys2009stress, haushofer2014psychology}.
Using a temporal discounting experiment, it can be quantified how the time horizon is affected at the behavioral level and then traced-back to its corresponding neural representation. Such experimental investigation can be designed to examine between-group and within-group effects (e.g., impulsive population like chronic gamblers or drug addicts); and brought in context with the participant’s age and personality traits.
% To exam-ine this question, Fellows and Farah (2005) investigated the effects of dorsolateral frontal (DLF) and ventromedial frontal (VMF) lobe damage on two aspects of temporal foresight—namely, temporal discounting and the futuretime perspective (measuredby an adaptation of Wallace’s [1956] list of future life events).

  propagated value information and triggered affective states encoded
  in the vmPFC may then feed into the functionally connected partner nodes of
  the DMN, such as the dmPFC and PMC \citep{andrews2010, bzdok2013segregation}.
}
  \label{fig:rl_process_chart}
\end{figure}








The HC may contribute to generating
perturbed action-transition-state-reward samples
as batches of pseudo-experience
(i.e., recalled, hypothesized, and forecasted scenarios).
The small variations in these experience samplings allow searching
a larger space of model parameters and possible experiences.
Taken to its extreme, stochastic recombination of experience
building blocks can further optimize the behavior of the RL agent
by model learning from scenarios in the environment that the agent might
only very rarely or never encounter.
An explanation is thus offered for experiencing seemingly familiar situations that
a human has however never actually encountered (i.e., d\'{e}j\`{a} vu effect).
While such a situation may not have been experienced in the physical world,
the DMN may have previously stochastically generated, evaluated, and adapted to
such a randomly synthesized event.
Generated representations arguably are ``internally manipulable,
and can be used for attempting actions internally,
before or instead of acting in the external reality,
and in diverse goal and sensory contexts, i.e. even outside the context in which they were learned''
\citep{pezzulo2011grounding}.
In the context of scarce environmental input and feedback
(e.g., mind-wandering or sleep),
mental scene construction allows pseudo-experiencing possible
future scenarios and action outcomes.

\paragraph*{Interplay with memory and “mind-searching” (Animals)} We hypothesize that experience replay for browsing problem solutions subserved by the DMN is contributing to choice behavior in mice. Hippocampal single-cell recordings have shown that neural patterns during experimental choice behavior are reiterated during sleep and before making analogous choices in the future. Necessity of cortical DMN regions, in addition to the hippocampus, for “mind-searching” candidate actions during choice behavior can be experimentally corroborated by causal disruption of DMN regions, such as by circumscribed brain lesion or optogenetic intervention in the inferior parietal and prefrontal cortices.







From the perspective of a RL agent,
prediction in the DMN reduces to
generalization of
policy and value computations from sampled experiences to
successful action choices and reward predictions in future states.
As such,
plasticity in the DMN arises naturally.
If an agent behaving optimally in a certain environment moves
to new, yet unexperienced environment, reward prediction errors will
largely increase.
This feedback will lead to adaptation of policy considerations
and value estimations until the intelligent system converges to a
new steady state of optimal action decisions in a volatile world.

\paragraph*{Synaptic epigenesis and creation of new entry in policy matrix (Humans \& Animals)} An additional layer of learning concerns the addition of new entries in the state and action spaces. Extension of the action repertoire could be biologically realized by synaptic epigenesis \citep{gisiger_acquisition_2005}. Indeed, the tuning of synaptic weights through learning can stabilize additional patterns of activity by creating new attractors in the neural dynamics landscape \citep{takeuchi_synaptic_2014}. Those attractors can then constrain both the number of factors taken into account by decision processes and the possible behaviors of the agent \citep{wang_decision_2008}. To examine this potential higher-level mechanism, we propose to probe how synaptic epigenesis is related to neural correlates underlying policy matrix updates: in humans the changes of functional connectivity between DMN regions can be investigated following a temporal discounting experiment and in monkeys or rodents anterograde tracing can be used to study how homolog regions of the DMN present increased synapti\c changes compare to other parts of the brain.

\section{Relation to existing accounts}

\subsection{Predictive coding hypothesis}
Predictive coding mechanisms
\citep{clark2013whatever, friston2008hierarchical}
are a frequently evoked idea in the context of default mode function
\citep{bar2007}.
Cortical responses are explained as
emerging from continuous functional interaction between
higher and lower levels of the neural processing hierarchy.
Feed-forward sensory processing is constantly calibrated by
top-down modulation from more multi-sensory and associative brain regions
further away from primary sensory cortical regions.
The dynamic interplay between cortical processing levels
may enable learning about aspects of the world by reconciling
gaps between fresh sensory input and predictions computed
based on stored prior information.
At each stage of neural processing,
an internally generated expectation of aspects of environmental sensations is
directly compared against the actual environmental input.
A prediction error at one of the processing levels
induces plasticity changes of neuronal projections
% (i.e., adapting model parameters)
to allow for gradually improved future prediction of the environment.
In this way,
the predictive coding hypothesis offers explanations for
the constructive, non-deterministic nature of sensory perception
\citep{friston2010free, buzsaki2006rhythms} and
the intimate relation of motor movement to sensory expectations
\citep{wolpert1995internal, kording2004bayesian}.
Contextual integration of sensorimotor perception-action cycles
may be maintained by top-down modulation
using internally generated information about the environment.



In short, predictive coding processes
conceptualize updates of the internal representation of the environment
to best accommodate and prepare the organism
for processing the constant influx of sensory stimuli and
performing action on the environment.
There are hence a number of common properties
between the predictive coding account
and the proposed formal account of DMN function based on MDPs.
Importantly,
a generative model of how perceived sensory cues arise in the
world would be incorporated into
the current neuronal wiring.
Further,
both functional accounts are supported by
neuroscientific evidence that suggest
the human brain to be a ``statistical organ'' \citep{friston2014phantastic}
with the biological purpose to
generalize from the past to new experiences.
Neuroanatomically, axonal
back projections indeed outnumber by far the axonal connections mediating feedforward input processing
in the monkey brain and probably also in humans
\citep{salin1995corticocortical}.
These many and diverse top-down modulations
from higher onto downstream cortical areas
can inject prior knowledge
at every stage of processing environmental information.
%
Moreover,
both accounts provide a parsimonious explanation for why the
human brain's processing load devoted to incoming information decreases
when the environment becomes predictable.
This is because the internal generative
model only requires updates after discrepancies have occurred between
environmental reality and its internally reinstantiated representation.
Increased computation resources are however allocated
when unknown stimuli or
unexpected events are encountered by the organism.
The predictive coding and MDP account hence
naturally evoke a mechanism of brain plasticity in that
neuronal wiring gets increasingly adapted
when faced by unanticipated environmental challenges.


While sensory experience is a constructive process from both views,
the predictive coding account frames
sensory perception of the external world
as a generative experience due to the modulatory top-down influence at
various stages of sensory input processing.
This generative top-down design is replaced in our MDP view of the DMN
by a sequential decision-making framework.
Further,
the hierarchical processing aspect from predictive coding
is re-expressed in our account in the form of
nested prediction of probable upcoming actions, states, and outcomes.
While both accounts capture the consequences of action,
the predictive coding account is typically explained without
explicit parameterization of the agent's time horizon and
has a tendency to be presented as emphasizing prediction about the
immediate future.
In the present account, the horizon of that
look into the future is made explicit in the $\gamma$ parameter
of the Bellman equation.
% \item \suggestremove{Mismatch negativity of PC is immanent in reward prediction error
% by the difference between actually predicted reward of an action given
% a state and the reward predicted by non-linear regression with graded
% discounting of future rewards.}
Finally,
the process of adapting the neuronal connections
for improved top-down modulation
takes the concrete form of stochastic gradient computation and
back-propagation in our MDP implementation.
It is however important to note that
the neurobiological plausibility of
the back-propagation procedure is controversial
\citep{goodfellow2016deep}.


In sum,
recasting DMN function in terms of MDPs therefore naturally incorporates
a majority of aspects from the prediction coding hypothesis.
The present MDP account of DMN function may therefore
serve as a concrete implementation of
many predictive coding ideas.
MDPs have the advantage of exposing an explicit
mechanisms for modulating the horizon of future considerations and for
how the internal representation of the world is updated,
as well as why certain predictions may be more relevant to the agent than others.




\subsection{Semantic hypothesis}
This frequently proposed cognitive account to explain DMN function revolves
around forming logical associations and abstract analogies between
experiences and conceptual knowledge derived from past behavior
\citep{bar2007proactive, binder1999conceptual, constantinescu2016organizing}.
Analogies might naturally tie incoming new sensory stimuli to
explicit world knowledge (i.e., semantics)
\citep{bar2009proactive}.
The encoding of complex environmental features could thus be facilitated
by association to known similar states.
%
Going beyond isolated meaning and concepts extracted from the world,
semantic building blocks may need to get recombined to enable
mental imagery to (fore)see never-experienced scenarios.
As such, semantic knowledge would be an important ingredient for optimizing behavior
by constantly simulating possible future scenarios
\citep{boyer2008evolutionary, binder2011neurobiology}.
Such cognitive processes can afford
the internal construction and elaboration of necessary information
that is not presented in the immediate sensory environment
by recombining building blocks of
concept knowledge and episodic memories
\citep{hassabis2009construction}.
Indeed, in aging humans, remembering the past and imagining the future
equally decreased in the level of detail and were associated with
concurrent deficits in forming and integrating relationships between
items \citep{addis2008age, spreng2006temporal}.





Further,
% a constructive account can explain the reciprocal relationship
% between an egocentric first person perspective and
% an allocentric bird’s eye perspective immersed in
% self-reflection, semantic associations, and autobiographical memories.
% %
% Cognitive aspects of egocentric-allocentric switching
episodic memory, language, problem solving,
planning, estimating others' thoughts, and spatial navigation
represent neural processes that are likely to
build on abstract world knowledge and logical associations
for integrating the constituent elements in rich and coherent mental scenes
\citep{schacter2007remembering}.
``[Foresight] and simulations are not only automatically elicited by external events but can be endogenously generated when needed. [...] The mechanism of access via simulation could be a widespread method for accessing and producing knowledge, and represents a valid alternative to the traditional idea of storage and retrieval''
\citep{pezzulo2011grounding}.
Such mental scene-construction processes could contribute to interpreting the
present and foreseeing the future.
Further, mental scene imagery has been proposed
to imply a distinction between
engagement in the sensory environment
and internally generated mind-wandering
\citep{buckner2007self}.
These investigators stated that
``A computational model [...] will probably require a form of
regulation by which perception of the current world is suppressed
while simulation of possible alternatives are constructed,
followed by a return to perception of the present''.
% The semantic hypothesis is for instance supported by evidence in animals that
% could learn a \textit{cognitive map of the environment}
% and exploit it later for other means \citep{tolman1948cognitive}.


In comparison,
both the semantic hypothesis and the present formal account based on MDPs
expose mechanisms of how action considerations could be explored.
In both accounts,
there is also little reason to assume that contemplating alternative realities of various
levels of complexity, abstraction, time scale, and purpose
rely on mechanisms that are qualitatively different. This interpretation concurs with
DMN activity increases across time, space, and content domains
demonstrated in many brain-imaging studies
\citep{spreng2009common, laird2009, bzdok2012morality, binder2009}.
Further, the semantic hypothesis
and MDP account offer explanations why HC damage does
not only impair recalling past events, but also imagining hypothetical and future
scenarios \citep{hassabis2007patients}.
While both semantic hypothesis and
our formal account propose memory-enabled, internally
generated information for probabilistic representation of action outcomes,
MDPs render explicit the grounds on which an action is
eventually chosen, namely, the estimated cumulative reward.
In contrast to many versions of the semantic hypothesis,
the MDPs naturally integrate the egocentric view
(more related to current action, state, and reward) and the
world view (more related to past and future actions, states, and rewards)
on the world in a same optimization problem.
Finally,
the semantic account of DMN function does not provide
suffcient explanation of \textit{how}
explicit world knowledge and logical analogies thereof
lead to foresight of future actions and states.
The semantic hypothesis does also not fully explain why memory recall
for scene construction in humans is typically fragmentary and noisy
instead of accurate and reliable.
In contrast to existing accounts on semantics and
mental scene construction, the random and creative aspects of DMN function
are explained in MDPs by the advantages of stochastic optimization.
Our MDP account provides an algorithmic explanation in that
stochasticity of the parameter space exploration
by Monte Carlo approximation achieves better fine-tuning of the
action policies and inference of expected reward outcomes.
That is, the purposeful stochasticity of policy and value updates
in MDPs provides a candidate explanation for why humans may
have evolved imperfect noisy memories
as the more advantageous adaptation.
In sum, mental scene construction according to the semantic
account is lacking an explicit time and incentive structure,
both of which are integral parts of the MDP interpretation of DMN function.



\subsection{Sentinel hypothesis}
Regions of the DMN have been proposed to process the
experienced or expected relevance of environment cues
\citep{montague2006imaging}.
Processing self-relevant information was perhaps the first
functional account that was proposed for the DMN
\citep{gusnard2001medial, raichle2001pnas}.
Since then,
many investigators have speculated that neural activity in the DMN
may reflect the brain's continuous tracking of
relevance in the environment, such as spotting predators,
as an advantageous evolutionary adaptation \citep{randy2008, hahn2007cingulate}.
According to this cognitive account, the human brain's baseline maintains
a ``radar'' function to
detect subjectively relevant cues and unexpected events in the environment.
Propositions of a sentinel function to underlie DMN activity
have however seldom detailed
the mechanisms of
how attention and memory resources are exactly reallocated when
encountering a self-relevant environmental stimulus.
Instead,
in the present MDP account,
promising action trajectories
are recursively explored by the human DMN. Conversely,
certain branches of candidate action trajectories
are detected to be less worthy to get explored.
This mechanism, expressed by the Bellman equation,
directly implies stratified allocation of attention and working memory load
over relevant cues and events in the environment.




Further,
our account provides a parsimonious explanation for
the consistently observed DMN implication
in certain goal-directed experimental tasks and
in task-unconstrained mind-wandering \citep{smith2009, bzdok2016formal}.
Both environment-detached and environment-engaged
cognitive processes may entail DMN recruitment
if real or imagined experience is processed, manipulated, and
used in service of organism control.
During active engagement in tasks,
the policy and value estimates may be
updated to optimize especially short-term action.
At passive rest, these parameter updates may
improve especially mid- and long-term action.
This horizon of the agent
is expressed in the $\gamma$ parameter in the MDP account.
We thus provide answers for the currently unsettled question why the involvement
of the same neurobiological brain circuit (i.e., DMN) has been documented
for specific task performances and baseline 'house-keeping' functions.



In particular,
environmental cues that are especially important for humans are frequently of
social nature. This may not be surprising
given that
the complexity of the social systems
is likely to be a human-defining property
\citep{tomasello2009cultural, dunbar2007science}.
According to the ``social brain hypothesis'',
the human brain has especially been shaped for
forming and maintaining increasingly complex
social systems,
which allows solving ecological problems by means of social relationships
\citep{whiten1988machiavellian}.
In fact, social topics probably amount to roughly
two thirds of human everyday communication \citep{dunbar1997human}.
Mind-wandering at daytime and dreams during sleep
are also rich in stories about people and
the complex interactions between them.
%
In line with this, DMN activity was advocated to be specialized in
continuous processing of social information as a
physiological baseline of human brain function
\citep{schilbach2008minds}. This view was later challenged by observing
analogues of the DMN in monkeys \citep{mantini2011default},
cats \citep{popa2009contrasting},
and rats \citep{lu2012rat}, three species with
social capacities that can be expected to be less advanced than in humans.


Moreover,
the principal connectivity gradient in the cortex appears to be greatly expanded in humans compared to monkeys, suggesting a phylogenetically conserved axis of cortical expansion with the DMN emerging at the extreme end in humans \citep{margulies_situating_2016}. Computational models of dyadic whole-brain dynamics
demonstrated how the human connectivity topology, on top of facilitating processing at the intra-individual level, can explain our propensity to coordinate through sensorimotor loops with others at the inter-individual level \citep{dumas_anatomical_2012}.
The DMN is moreover largely overlapping with neural networks associated with higher-level social processes \citep{schilbach_introspective_2012}. For instance, the vmPFC,
PMC, and RTPJ
together may play a key role in bridging the gap between self and other by
integrating low-level embodied processes within higher level inference-based mentalizing
\citep{lombardo_shared_2009, social_brain_atlas}.


Rather than functional specificity for processing social information in particular,
the present MDP account can parsimoniously incorporate
the dominance of social content in
human mental activity
as high value function estimates for information about humans
\citep{baker2009action, kampe2001psychology, krienen2010clan}.
The DMN may thus modulate reward processing
in the human agent in a way that prioritizes
appraisal of and action towards social contexts,
without excluding relevance of environmental cues of the physical world.
In sum,
our account on the DMN directly implies
its previously proposed ``sentinel'' function
of monitoring the environment for self-relevant information
in general and
inherently accommodates the importance of social environmental cues
as a special case.


\subsection{The free-energy principle and active inference}
% INTRO
According to theories of the \textit{free-energy principle} (FEP) and
\textit{active inference} \citep{friston2010free, fristonAIorRL,dayan1995helmholtz},
the brain corresponds to
a biomechanical reasoning engine. It is
dedicated to minimizing the long-term average of surprise: the log-likelihood of the observed sensory input --more precisely, an upper bound thereof-- relative to the expectations about the external world derived from internal representations. The brain
would continuously generate hypothetical explanations of the world
and predict its sensory input $\bf{x}$ (analogous to the state-action $(s, a)$ pair in an MDP
framework).
% Precursors of this interpretation can be traced back to Dayan and colleagues \citep{dayan1995helmholtz}
% who introduced the \textit{Helmholtz machine}, a hierarchical factorial directional deep belief network. According to the FEP account,
% the goal of the brain is to optimize over a generative model $G$ of sensations: to iteratively
% modify its internal representation $p_G(\z|\x)$ of objects in the world, their interactions and dynamics. The model then allows
% to minimize surprise when these representations are confronted with sensory input $\x$ during action-perception cycles (i.e., the \textit{generative} model).
% The FEP also proposes a companion model called the \textit{recognition} model $p_R(\z|\x)$,
% which works in tandem with the generative model to accomplish approximate inference. Put differently, the recognition model dreams imaginary worlds $\z$,
% while the generative model tries to produce sensory sensations $\x \sim p_G(\x|\z)$ which match these
% imagined mental scenarios.
However, surprise is challenging to optimize numerically
because we need to sum over all hidden causes $\z$ of the sensations (an intractable problem).
Instead, FEP therefore minimizes an upper-bound on surprise given by

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \text{generative surprise } &:= -\log(p_G(\x)) = F_G(\x) \\
    &=\underbrace{F^R_G(\x)}_{\text{accuracy}} - \underbrace{\operatorname{{KL}}(p_R(\z|\x) \| p_G(\z|\x))}_{\text{complexity}} \\
    &\le F^R_G(\x),
    \text{ with equality if }p_R(\z|\x) = p_G(\z|\x)\text{ for all } \z.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  F_G^R(\x) := \langle -\log(p_G(\z, \x))\rangle_{p_R(\z|\x)} - \mathcal H(p_R(\z|\x))
\end{equation}
is the \textit{free energy}.
Here, the angular brackets denote the \textit{expectation} of the joint negative log-likelihood $-\log(p_G(\z, \x))$ w.r.t the recognition density $p_R(\z|\x)$, $\mathcal H$ is the \textit{entropy} function defined by $\mathcal H(p) := -\sum_{\z}p(\z)\log(p(\z)$, while $\operatorname{KL}(.\|.)$ is the usual \textit{Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence} (also known as \textit{relative entropy}) defined by $\operatorname{KL}(p\|q) := \sum_{z}p(\z)\log(p(\z)/q(\z)) \ge 0$,
which is a measure of difference between two probability distributions. In this framework, the goal of the agent is to iteratively refine the generative model $p_G$ and the recognition model $p_R$ so as to minimize the free energy $F_G^R(\x)$ over sensory input $\x$.

Importantly, $F^R_G(x)$ gets low in the following cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item  $p_R(\z|\x)$ puts a lot of mass on configurations $(\z,\x)$ which are $p_G$-likely
% (i.e the sensation $\x$ is likely caused by $\z$)
%  \textbf{and}
\item $p_R(\z|\x)$ is as uniform as possible (i.e have high entropy), so as not to concentrate
  all its mass on a small subset of possible causes for the sensation $\x$
  \end{itemize}
% The optimization procedure proposed by the authors derives from the \textit{wake-sleep algorithm} \citep{dayan1995helmholtz}.
% \begin{figure}[!tb]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{vae.pdf}
%   \caption{Variational autoencoders...}
%   \label{fig:vae}
% \end{figure}


% CRITICISM
% \paragraph{Main criticisms.}
Despite its popularity, criticism against the FEP has been voiced over the years,
which we allude to in the following.
The main algorithm for minimizing free energy $F_G^R(\x)$ is the \textit{wake-sleep algorithm}
\citep{dayan1995helmholtz}. As these authors noted,
a crucial drawback of the wake-sleep algorithm (and therefore of theories like the FEP \citep{friston2010free}) is that it involves a pair
of forward (generation) and backward (recognition) models $p_G$ and $p_R$ that
together does not correspond to optimization of (a bound of) the marginal likelihood
because KL divergence is not symmetric in its arguments.



These considerations render the brain less likely to implement the wake-sleep algorithm or a variant thereof. More recently,
\textit{variational auto-encoders} (VAEs) \citep{kingma2013auto} emerged that may provide an efficient alternative to the wake-sleep algorithm. VAEs
overcome a number of the technical limits of the wake-sleep algorithm
by using a reparametrization maneuver, which makes it possible to do differential calculus on random sampling procedures without exploding variance. As a result, unlike the wake-sleep algorithm
for minimizing free energy, VAEs can be efficiently trained via back-propagation of prediction errors.



The difference between the FEP and the MDP account may be further clarified by a thought experiment.
Since theories based on the FEP \citep{friston2010free,fristonAIorRL}
conceptualize ongoing behavior
in an organism to be geared towards the surprise-minimizing goal,
an organism entering a dark room
% \footnote{\textit{Dark} is used here as an allegory to indicate the complete absence of any \textit{external} sensory input.}

% (Fig. \ref{fig:darkroom})

would remain trapped in this location
because its sensory inputs are perfectly predictable
given the environmental state \citep{darkroom2012}.
% \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.37\linewidth}
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{darkroom_resized.png}
%   \caption{\textbf{The dark room experiment.} An intelligent agent situated
%   in a light-deprived closed space is used
%   as a thought experiment for the complete absence
%   of external sensory input.
%   % The free-energy principle theory paradoxally predicts that such an agent would remain quietly in this room, such it perfectly predict all sensory input from such an environment.
%   % However such behavior is not observed in humans or any animals: the agent would strive to leave such an environment in search of more ``interesting'' worlds.
%   }
%   \label{fig:darkroom}
% \end{wrapfigure}
However, such a behavior is seldom observed in humans in the
real world. In a dark room, the intelligent agents would search for light sources by explore
the surroundings or aim to exit the room.
Defenders of the FEP have retorted by advancing the ``full package'' \citep{darkroom2012}:
FEP is framed as being multi-scale, and there would be one scale at which
the organism would
be \textit{surprised} by a \textit{lack of surprise}.
One may object that a dark room would paradoxically correspond to a state of particularly high relevance.
Driven by the surprise-minimization objective, the FEP agent would eventually not bootstrap itself out of such saddle points to explore more interesting parts of the environment.
% Recourse to this argument is equivalent to invoking a \textit{halting oracle}\citep{haltingoracle}, an arbitrarily powerful machine which can solve the \textit{halting problem} (an arbitrarily difficult computational problem which cannot be solved under any reasonable \textit{model of computation}, not even in principle!). But this is problematic as it sucks up the problem (that of decision-making and active agency) the theory intends to elude in the first place.
In contrast, an organism operating under our RL-based theory would inevitably
identify the sensory-stimulus-deprived room as a local minimum. Indeed, hippocampal experience replay (see \ref{sec:self}) could serve to sample memories or fantasies of alternative situations
with reward structure. Such artificially generated \textit{internal} sensory input,
potentially subserved by the DMN, could then entice the organism to explore the room,
for instance by looking for and using the light switch or finding the room exit.

% \paragraph{Links between FEP and RL.}
We finally note that FEP and active inference can be reframed in terms of
our RL framework.
This becomes possible by recasting the Q-value function (i.e., expected long-term reward) maximized by the DMN to
correspond to negative surprise,
that is, the log-likehood of current sensory priors
the agent has about the world. More explicitly, this corresponds to using free-energy as a Q-value approximator for the MDP in the following way:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  -Q \approx \underbrace{F^R_G(\x)}_{\text{negative free energy}} \approx \underbrace{-\log (p_G)}_{\text{FEP generative surprise}}.
    \end{eqnarray*}
% \paragraph{Comparison to our proposed theory.}
% On the surface, a common point between the FEP and our proposed RL-based framework
%   is placing the minimization of a surprise signal at the core of brain function.
%   Indeed in RL, surprise minimization is subsumed  by accurate prediction of
%   rewarding outcomes in the future. A ``free-energy'' agent is barely a biomechanical machine which has the tendency to resist undesired phase-transitions
%   \citep{friston2010free,fristonAIorRL,ortega2013thermodynamics}.
Such a surprise-guided RL scheme has previously been advocated
under the equivalent framework of energy-based RL
% \footnote{These methods assume that the posterior distribution  of the hidden states $\z$ given the visible states $\x$ factorizes, leading to so-called RBMs --\textit{Restricted Boltzmann Machines}. One notes, that even with these simplifications, such a model can be very hard to train.}
~\citep{sallans2004,elfwing2016free} and information compression \citep{schmidhuber2010,mohamed2015}.
Nevertheless, minimization of surprise quantities alone
may be insufficient to explain the diversity of behaviors that humans and other intelligent animals can perform.
% The dark-room experiment, for example, provides a formidable argument against in favor of the insufficiency of the FEP and active inference theories to explain intelligent behavior in humans: when a human is put in a dark room, they don't just sit down in a corner forever, what would be the FEP-optimal thing to do; they actively search for the light switch, and start exploring the depths of the room, possibly looking for food or the way out!

% Friston's critic of RL \citep{fristonAIorRL} (he proposes ``active inference''): "This equation (equation 18) comes from the theory of dynamic programming,
% pioneered in the 1950s by Richard Bellman and colleagues [2]. To
% optimise control a~pð Þ x~ under this formulation, we have to: (i)
% assume the hidden states are available to the agent and (ii) solve
% Equation 18 for the value-function. Solving for the value-function
% is a non-trivial problem and usually involves backwards induction
% or some approximation scheme like reinforcement learning [4–6].
% The free-energy formulation circumvents these problems by
% prescribing the policy in terms of free-energy, which encodes
% optimal control (Equation 6)"

% The following critics can be made:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     As noted by Dayan et al. (\textit{Variants of Helmholtz machines}), the inter-neuronal intra-layer independence assumption which is at the center of the HM becomes severely problematic as it is agnostic to the known organization of cortical layers...
%   \item A drawback of the wake-sleep algorithm is that it requires a concurrent models (generative and recognitiion), which together do not correspond to optimization of (a bound of) the marginal likelihood (because of the incorrect KL used therein, etc.).
%   \item Also, note that the wake-sleep algorithm doesn't do backprop! This is due to
%     technical difficulty in getting derivatives of loss function w.r.t
%     recognition weights $\W^R$).
%   \item This difficulty was removed in the 2010s by \citep{kingma2013auto}, an other groups, via a ``reparametrization trick''.

\section{Conclusion}
Which brain function could be important enough
for the existence and survival of the human species
to justify constantly high energy costs?
While previous experiments on the DMN frequently set out to investigate
\textit{what} its subserved function may be,
we have proposed a way of reasoning
\textit{how} this major network may do what it is doing.
%
MDPs motivate an attractive
formal account of how the human association cortex
can be thought to implement multi-sensory representation and high-level decision-making to
optimize the organism's behavioral strategies.
% by obtaining reward and avoiding pain.
This idealized process model accommodates
a number of previous observations from neuroscience studies on the
DMN by simple but non-trivial mechanisms.
%
Viewed as a Markovian sequential decision process,
human behavior unfolds by inferring expected reward outcomes
from hypothetical action cascades
% stored past events
and extrapolation from past experience to
upcoming events for guiding behavior in the present.
MDPs also provide a formalism how
opportunity in the environment can be deconstructed, evaluated, and exploited
when confronted with challenging interdependent decisions.
%
This abstract process interpretation may well be compatible with the DMN's
poorly understood involvement across
autobiographical memory recall, problem solving,
abstract reasoning, social cognition,
as well as delay discounting and self-prospection into the future.
%
For instance, improvement of the internal world representation
by injecting stochasticity into the recall of past
actions and inference of action outcomes may explain why
highly accurate memories have been disfavored in human evolution
and why human creativity may be adaptive.




A major hurdle in guessing DMN function from cognitive brain-imaging studies has been its similar neural engagement in different time scales: thinking about the past (e.g., autobiographical memory retrieval), thinking about hypothetical presents (e.g., daytime mind-wandering), and
anticipating scenarios yet to come (e.g., delay discounting).
The MDP account of DMN activity offers a natural integration of a-priori diverging neural processes into a common framework.
%
It is an important advantage of the proposed artificial intelligence perspective
on DMN biology that it is practically computable and
readily motivates neuroscientific hypotheses that can be put to the test in future research.
%
Future neuroscience experiments on the DMN should operationalize
the set of action, value, and state variables governing
the behavior of intelligent RL agents.
%
At the least, we propose an alternative vocabulary to
describe, contextualize, and interpret experimental findings in neuroscience studies
on higher-level cognition.
%
Ultimately,
neural processes in the DMN may realize a brain-wide information integration
ranging from real experience over purposeful dreams to predicted futures
to continuously refine the organism's intervention on the world.

% \subsection{Does hippocampal replay equal inverse reinforcement-learning?}
% %\begin{mdframed}
%   Given the trace $s_0,a_0,s_1,\ldots,$ of an optimal agent's strategy $\pi^*$ in
%   an MDP (called a \textit{teacher's demonstration}), can we figure out what is the
%   (instantaneous) reward function $r: \mathcal S \times \mathcal \mathcal A
%   \rightarrow \mathbb R$ that the agent is optimizing over a prescribed class of reward functions
%   (e.g., linear rewards $r(s,a) \equiv \theta^T\phi(s,a)$)?
%   For instance, given traces of motor actions from an adult to grab a cup on a table,
%   can an observing child figure out what ``langragian'' functional is being minimized by the former?
%   How? Can they reproduce this optimal behavior?
% %\end{mdframed}
% Such questions are of course pertinent to our decision-making theory for the DMN.
% In the general artificial case, the problem has been extensively studied and partially solved by
% \citep{abbeel2004}. They are also been rigorously studied in general optimal control literature under the name
% ``inverse optimal control'', but in model-based certain (where the physical dynamics are known, etc.)...
% 
% IRL is is suited for problems in which it's hard to define what the reward function could be
% (e.g.,  car-driving, drone maneuvering, etc.) ...
% 
% \section{Free-energy principles!}
% The so-called free-energy principle in its present form (including notions like ``generative density'', ``recognition density'', etc.) can be traced back to works of Dayan \& Hinton \citep{dayan1995helmholtz} in which they introduced the so-called \textit{Helmholtz machine}, a hierarchical factorial directional deep belief-net (DBN).
% In this subsection, we will develop from first-principles, the bare-bones minimalistic ideas needed to build a free-energy principle for general decision-making. This ideas were first developed by Hinton et al. in the early 90s in building their Helmholtz machine. Theories like Friston's free-energy principle and active-inference will then emerge as particular instances of this general framework, with particular design choises. For instance, the Friston theory axiomatizes that the brain uses a (problematic, as it implicitly assumes that posterior of each hidden unit is factorial) wake-sleep algorithm to train the underlying Helmholtz machine, etc.
% 
% % \begin{mdframed}
% %   Though our presentation of free-energy principles is thermodynamic in flavor, a completely equivalent
% %   information-theoretic formulation is of course possible, simply by exploiting the information-theoretic interpretation of entropy.

% Our starting point will be to build an approximation $p_G$ for the true density $p$ of the observations, so that this approximate density corresponds to the partition function of thermodynamic system. So,
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   \begin{split}

%     &= \langle E_G(., \x) \rangle_{p_G(. |\x)} - \mathcal H(p_G(. |\x))
%   \end{split}
%   \label{eq:helm}
% \end{eqnarray}
% where $E_G(\z, \x)$ is the energy at \textit{macrostate} $\z$ of a fictive thermodynamic system defined by setting
% \begin{equation}
%   E_G(\z, \x) := -\log(p_G(\z, \x)),
%   \label{eq:gibbs}
% \end{equation}
% %% In the above, the variable $\z$ is a hidden variable, and can / should be interpreted as the unobservable state of the external world.
% The last quantity in \eqref{eq:helm} is nothing but \textit{Helmholtz free-energy} (at unit temperature!), defined formally by
% \begin{equation}
%   F_G(\x) := \langle E_G(., \x) \rangle_{p_G(. |\x)} - \mathcal H(p_G(. |\x)).
% \end{equation}
% %% , modelled as the physical system for which $p_G(\z|\x)$ dictates the occupation probabilities of macrostates $\z$
% Thus,
% \begin{fact}
%   Generative surprise and generative Helmholtz free-energy are different views on exactly the same object.
% \end{fact}
% 
% The goal of the brain is then to optimize over the generative model $G$: to iteratively or analytically modify the generative density $p_G(.|\x)$, so as to minimize surprise. It turns out that a direct attempt to attack this optimization problem by gradient descent on the free-energy $F_G(\x)$ is furtile: the parameter update steps are not ``very clean'', and require rather cumbersome and heavy computations. A workaround is then to introduce a second density $p_R(.|\x)$ called a \textit{recognition} density to work in tandem with the generative density $p_G(.|\x)$, as a trick for doing approximate inference. The former dreams / fantacizes whilst the latter tries to generate sensations which match these dreams! This primal-dual idea, first proposed in Hinton et al. 1995, is at the heart of the general free-energy principle that we will introduce shortly.
% 
% \subsection{Variational Helmholtz free-energy and the bottom-up recognition sub-model}
% In this subsection, we will present an insightful upper bound for the generative surprise (i.e., generate Helmholtz free-energy), called the \textit{variational} (Helmholtz) free-energy. As an avant-gout of what is to come shorty, let's just note that the well-known \textit{free-energy principle} is simply a workaround whereby the minimization surprise (intractable) is replaced with the  minimization a carefully chosen upper bound thereof.
% 
% Invoking \eqref{eq:gibbs} and applying Bayes rule, we get the Gibbs
% distribution
% \begin{equation}
%   p_G(\z|\x) = \frac{p_G(\z|\x)}{p_G(\x)} = \frac{\exp(-E_G(\z, \x))}{Z_G(\x)} = \frac{\exp(-E_G(\z, \x))}{Z_G(\x)},
% \end{equation}
% where $Z_G(\x) := \log(p_G(\x)) = \sum_{\z'}\exp(-E_G(\z',\x))$, the normalizing \textit{partition function} for the model \ref{eq:gibbs}.
% Whence, for any macrostate $\z$, we have $p_G(\x) = Z_G(\x) = \exp(-E_G(\z, \x)) / p_G(\z|\x)$, and so it holds that
% \begin{equation}
% F_G(\x)\overset{\eqref{eq:helm}}{=} -\log(p_G(\x)) = -\log(Z_G(\x)) = E_G(\z, \x) + \log(p_G(\z|\x)).
% \end{equation}
% Now, in the above equation, the LHS only depends on the generative model $G$ and the data point $\x$:
% it doesn't depend on the hidden variable $\z$, etc. So, taking expectations w.r.t an arbitrary
% density\footnote{conditioning in $p_R(.|\x)$ is because this density is selected from a world in which the sensory inputs and internal brain
%   state vector $\x$ is assumed already observed.} $p_R(.|\x)$ yields
% \begin{equation}
%   \begin{split}
%     F_G(\x) &= -\log(Z_G(\x)) = \langle E_G(., \x)\rangle_{p_R(.|\x)} + \sum_{\z}p_R(\z|\x)\log(p_G(\z|\x))\\
%     &= \langle E_G(., \x)\rangle_{p_R(.|\x)} - \mathcal H(p_R(.|\x)) - \sum_{\z}p_R(\z|\x)\log(p_R(\z|\x)/p_G(\z|\x))\\
%     &= F^R_G(\x) - D_{KL}(p_R(.|\x) || p_G(.|\x)),
%   \end{split}
%   \label{eq:fe}
% \end{equation}
% where $F^R_G(\x)$ is the \textit{variational} Helmholtz free-energy from $R$ to $G$ defined by
% \begin{equation}
%   F^R_G(\x) := \langle E_G(., \x)\rangle_{p_R(.|\x)} - \mathcal H(p_R(.|\x))
% \end{equation}
% and $D_{KL}(p_R(.|\x) || p_G(.|\x))$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the $p_R(.|\x)$ and the generative density $p_G(.|\x)$. Note that $F^G_G = F_G$.
% 
% \subsection{A general free-energy principle}
% We can resume the situation as follows\footnote{Where we have used the fact that KL divergence is always nonnegative.}:
% \begin{mdframed}
% \begin{equation}
%   \begin{split}
%     \text{generative surprise } &:= -\log(p_G(\x)) = F_G(\x) \\
%     &=\underbrace{F^R_G(\x)}_{\text{accuracy}} - \underbrace{D_{KL}(p_R(.|\x) || p_G(.|\x))}_{\text{complexity}} \\
%     &\le F^R_G(\x),
%     \text{ with equality if }p_R(\z|\x) = p_G(\z|\x)\text{ for all } \z
%     \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% \end{mdframed}
% %% In fact, we have the following theorem
% %% \begin{theorem}
% %%   It holds that
% %%   $$
% %%   \text{Minimal generative surprise = minimal (Helmholtz) variational free-energy},$$
% %%   i.e
% %%   \begin{equation}
% %%     \min_{G}F_G(\x) = \min_{G,R}F^R_G(\x)
% %%     \end{equation}
% %% \end{theorem}

% \subsection{Friston's active-inference and agency}
% \label{sec:friston}
% This is nothing but an application of the Dayan's wake-sleep algorithm for training a Helmholtz machine model of the brain...
% 
% The following critics can be made:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     As noted by Dayan et al. (\textit{Variants of Helmholtz machines}), the inter-neuronal intra-layer independence assumption which is at the center of the HM becomes severely problematic as it is agnostic to the known organization of cortical layers...
%   \item A drawback of the wake-sleep algorithm is that it requires a concurrent models (generative and recognitiion), which together do not correspond to optimization of (a bound of) the marginal likelihood (because of the incorrect KL used therein, etc.).
%   \item Also, note that the wake-sleep algorithm doesn't do backprop! This is due to
%     technical difficulty in getting derivatives of loss function w.r.t
%     recognition weights $\W^R$).
%   \item This difficulty was removed in the 2010s by \citep{kingma2013auto}, an other groups, via a ``reparametrization trick''.

% % \subsection{Free-energy minimization via variational auto-encoders}
% \label{sec:vae}
% Here, we present a way to alleviate some conceptual and computational issues with the
% free-energy framework presented thus far, by using the recent \textit{variational auto-encoder} (VAE) theory \citep{kingma2013auto}. Define the data-dependent
% auxiliary random function
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   f_{G,R}(., \x) :\z \mapsto \log(p_G(\z,\x)) - \log(p_R(\z|\x)).
% \end{eqnarray}
% Then we can rewrite the
% variational free-energy as
% \begin{eqnarray*}
%   \begin{split}
%     F_G^R(\x) &:= \langle E_G(., \x) \rangle_{p_R(. |\x)} - \mathcal H(p_R(. |\x)) = \langle E_G(., \x) + \log(p_R(.|\x))\rangle_{p_R(.|\x)}\\
%     &=\langle -\log(p_G(.,\x)) + \log(p_R(.|\x))\rangle_{p_R(.|\x)}\\
%     &= -\langle f_{G,R}\rangle_{p_R(.|\x)} \approx -\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^Mf_{G,R}(\z^{(m)}), \text{ with }\z^{(1)},\ldots,\z^{(M)} \sim p_R(.|\x), \text{ and }M \rightarrow \infty.
%     \end{split}
% \end{eqnarray*}
% 
% \begin{mdframed}
%   \textbf{Problem:} How do we sample from the recognition density $p_R(.|\x)$ in such a way that the sampling process is differentiable w.r.t the weights of the recognition network $\W^R$ ?

% \subsection{A thermodynamic model for bounded rationality, aka robust
%   optimality}
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Recall that an agent is said to have \textit{bounded rationality} if they must take into account the cost of finding solutions to problems, and not just the utility of the final state.
%   \item For example, consider an agent that must operate under a limited lifetime and/or computation cost.
%   \item This is in contrast to agents with \textit{unbounded rationality} considered in classical game theory.
%     \end{itemize}
% The material presented is a revisit of \citep{braun2011path}. See also \citep{ortega2013thermodynamics}
% \paragraph{Utility functions and conjugate pairs.}
%   Let $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$ be a probablity space. A function $U: \mathcal F \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is said to be a \textit{utility function} for this space if the conditional utility $U(A|B) := U(A \cap B) - U(B)$ has the following propertites:
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item additivity: $U(A_1 \cap A_2 | B) = U(A_1|B) + U(A_2|B)$, for all events $A_1, A_2, B \in \mathcal F$.
%   \item statistic: there exists a function $f_{U} :\mathbb R_+ \rightarrow \mathbb R$ such that $U(A|B) = f(P(A|B))$, for all events
%     $A,B \in \mathcal F$.
%   \item monotonicity: $f_{U}$ is strictly increasing.
%     \end{itemize}
% 
% \begin{theorem}
%   The only functions $f: \mathbb R_+ \rightarrow \mathbb R$ which is such that $U(A|B) \equiv f(P(A|B))$ any probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$ and utility function $U$ thereupon are of the form
%   \begin{equation}
%     f = \alpha \log(.),
%     \label{eq:boltzmann}
%   \end{equation}
%   where $\alpha > 0$.
% \end{theorem}
% 
% \textbf{XXX: equation \eqref{eq:boltzmann} above looks like Boltzmann's formula (on his gravestone...)!}
% 
% Such $U$ and $P$ are said to form a \textit{conjugate pair} at temperature $\alpha$.
% 
% 
% \paragraph{Example.}
% Given a utility function $U$ on a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal F, *)$, the \textit{Gibbs measure} at temperature $\alpha > 0$ and energy levels $(-U(\omega))_{\omega \in \Omega}$ is defined to be the probability measure (on thesame measurable space)
%   \begin{equation}
%     P(\omega) = \frac{1}{Z_{U}(\alpha)}\exp\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}U(\omega)\right), \; \forall \omega \in \Omega,
%   \end{equation}
%   where
% 
%   \begin{equation}
%     Z_{U}(\alpha) := \sum_{\omega \in \Omega}\exp\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}U(\omega)\right)
%   \end{equation}
%   is a normalization constant called the \textit{partition function} of $U$.
%   It's not hard to see that $U$ and the $P$ above form a conjugate pair.
% 
%   \paragraph{Free-utility functional.}
%     Let $(U, P)$ be a conjugate pair at temperature $\alpha > 0$  on a measurable space $(\Omega, \mathcal F)$. Given another probability measure $P'$ on the same space, define it's \textit{free utility} as
%     \begin{equation}
%       J(P'|U, P) = \langle U \rangle_{P'} + \alpha \mathcal H(P'),
%     \label{eq:free_u}
%     \end{equation}
%     where
%     \begin{equation}
%       \mathcal H(P') := \langle \log(P') \rangle_{P'} := -\sum_{\omega \in \Omega}P'(\omega)\log(P'(\omega))
%     \end{equation}
%     is the \textit{entropy} of $P'$ (measured in the Naperian base $e \approx 2.73$). It's not difficult to establish the upper bound
%   \begin{equation}
%     J(P'|U) \le J(P|U) = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega}U(\omega) =: U(\Omega).
%   \end{equation}
%   In particular, if $P$ is the Gibbs measure at temperature $\alpha$ corresponding to $U$, then the upper bound above reduces to the \textit{log-partition function}
%   \begin{equation}
%     J(P'|U) \le U(\Omega) = -\alpha \log(Z_{U}(\alpha)).
%     \end{equation}
% 
%   \paragraph{The free-energy / utility principle (of Friston ?).}
%   We are now in shape to introduce the notion of free-energy for model transitions, and a variational principle for optimizing it. Consider thus an initial system described by a conjugate pair $(U_{\text{ini}}, P_{\text{ini}})$ at temperature $\alpha > 0$. We want to transform this to a new model by adding constraints represented by the utility function $\Delta U$.  The resulting system has final utility $U_{\text{fin}} = U_{\text{ini}} + \Delta U$. The difference in free-utility is then
%   \begin{equation}
%     \Delta J_{(U_{\text{ini}}, P_{\text{ini}}) \rightarrow P_{\text{fin}}} := J_{\text{fin}} - J_{\text{ini}} = \underbrace{\langle \Delta U\rangle_{P_{\text{fin}}}}_{\textbf{accuracy}} -  \underbrace{\alpha D_{\text{KL}}(P_{\text{ini}}\|P_{\text{fin}})}_{\textbf{complexity}},
%     \label{eq:free}
%   \end{equation}
%   where
%   \begin{equation}
%     D_{\text{KL}}(P_{\text{fin}}\|P_{\text{ini}}) := \langle \log(\P_{\text{fin}}/\P_{\text{ini}})\rangle_{\P_{\text{fin}}} := \sum_{\omega \in \Omega}\P_{\text{fin}}(\omega)\log(\P_{\text{fin}}(\omega)/\P_{\text{ini}}(\omega))
%   \end{equation}
%   is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and represents the information cost (measured in energy units) of changing the initial system.
% In the above formula, we've extensively used the fact that $(U_{\text{ini}}, P_{\text{ini}})$ is a congugate pair and so $U_{\text{ini}}(\omega) \equiv \alpha \log(P_{\text{ini}}(\omega))$ by virtue of \eqref{eq:boltzmann}.
%   The two terms in \eqref{eq:free} (accuracy or expected gain in utility, and the complexity of the transition) can be viewed as dertiminants of bounded rational decision-making. They formalize
% a trade-off between an expected utility $\Delta U$ (first term) and
% the information cost of transforming Pi
% into $P_{\text{fin}}$ (second
% term). In this interpretation $P_{\text{ini}}$ represents an initial choice
% probability or policy, which includes the special case of the
% uniform distribution where the decision-maker has initially no
% preferences between the different choices. The probability measure $P_{\text{fin}}$ is the final choice probability that we are looking for since it
% considers the utility constraint U∗
% that we want to optimize. We can then formulate a variational principle for bounded rationality in the probabilities $P_{\text{fin}}(\omega)$
% \begin{equation}
% P^*_{\text{fin}} := \underset{P_{\text{fin}}}{\text{argmax }} \Delta J_{(U_{\text{ini}}, P_{\text{ini}}) \rightarrow P_{\text{fin}}}
%   \end{equation}
% 
% By differentiating the RHS of \eqref{eq:free} w.r.t $P_{\text{fin}}$ and setting to zero, we obtain the closed-form solution
% 
% \begin{equation}
%   P^*_{\text{fin}}(\omega) \propto P_{\text{ini}}(\omega)\exp\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\Delta U(\omega)\right).
% \end{equation}
% 
% Two limit cases are worth considering.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Low-temperature regime $\alpha \approx 0$:} Here $\Delta J_{(U_{\text{ini}}, P_{\text{ini}}) \rightarrow P_{\text{fin}}} \approx \langle \Delta U\rangle_{P'_{\text{fin}}}$, and so it's optimal to take
%   $$P^*_{\text{fin}}(\omega) \equiv \text{dirac}(\omega - \omega^*) = \begin{cases}1, &\mbox{if }\omega = \omega^*,\\0, &\mbox{ otherwise,}\end{cases}$$
%   where $\omega^* := \argmax_{\omega \in \Omega}U(\omega)$. This corresponds to unbounded rational decision-making, in which the cost of transition / problem-solving is completely disregarded.
%   \item \textbf{High-temperature regime $\alpha \rightarrow +\infty$:} In this limiting case, it's optimal to take $P^*_{\text{fin}}(\omega) \equiv P_{\text{ini}}(\omega)$, i.e the change is so costly that it's optimal to maintain the current choice probabilities.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% To conclude this section, let's note that \citep{braun2011path} show how their free-energy framework (on paths) links with the well-known Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman optimal control framework. For example, one can re-derive the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller, which is a generalization of the LQR in \eqref{eq:hj}...
