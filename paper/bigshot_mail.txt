Dear Professor Tenenbaum,

Kristian Kersting introduced me to you a while ago. I am writing you today because we have recently drafted a manuscript that intersects human cognition and reinforcement learning systems to explain the energy-demanding baseline mental activity. We conceptualize continuous action policy computation and utility estimation in the so-called default mode network couched in terms of Markov decision processes. This formal attempt to explain the biological purpose of "mind-wandering" at day-time and dreams during sleep more parsimoniously captures, as special cases, a number of existing theories from cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience.

It would be fantastic to have your thoughts and corrections on the paper, if you find the time.


Best,
Danilo Bzdok
